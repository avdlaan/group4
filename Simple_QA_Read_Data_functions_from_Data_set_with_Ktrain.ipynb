            "['Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malignant malaria such as cerebral malaria (CM) or pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) [1, 2] , is the cause of death to 435,000 individuals annually [3] . Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which is encoded by the var gene family comprising approximately 60 members, is the major virulence factor involved in the antigenic variation and clinical pathogenicity of falciparum malaria [4, 5] . It is remarkable that the expression of var family members is mutually exclusive. For each parasite at a time, only one or a few var genes are expressed, while the remaining members are silenced [6, 7] . In each generation, P. falciparum is able to express different var genes, and the switches in var gene expression lead to antigenic variation of PfEMP1, which results in immune evasion and chronic infection [8] [9] [10] [11] . This process has proven to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including chromatin modification, nuclear architecture and gene relocation [12, 13] .\\nIt has been shown that the single active var gene is enriched in euchromatic modifications, such as histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), particularly near the transcriptional start site (TSS) [14] , while the silent var genes are usually enriched in the heterochromatin marker (histone 3 lysine9 trimethylation, H3K9me3) in the 5\\'UTR or the coding sequence [14] [15] [16] [17] . In this process, histone modifying enzymes such as PfMYST, PfGCN5, PfSIR2 and PfSET, have been considered important for epigenetic control of reversible histone modifications, according to previous studies [12, 13] . PfMYST, a putative histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in P. falciparum, is capable of acetylating multiple lysines on H4 [18, 19] , while an orthologue of the yeast HAT PfGCN5 influences acetylation of H3K9 and K14, both are essential marks of gene activation [18, 20] . Two paralogues of the class III HDAC (histone deacetylases) Sir2, play key roles in maintaining heterochromatin and mutually exclusive var gene expression [15, 21, 22] . PfSir2A deacetylates H3K9ac, H3K14ac and H4K16ac [23] , and is more important in silencing subtelomeric var genes such as upsA-, upsEand upsC-subtype vars. In contrast, PfSir2B silences upsB vars [22] . Furthermore, a total of ten P. falciparum histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) belonging to the SET domain family have been found in P. falciparum [18, 24, 25] . PfSET10 localizes to a specialized region at the nuclear periphery with the active vars such as H3K4me4 transferase [26] .\\nPlasmodium falciparum variant-silencing SET gene (PfSETvs) controls the H3K36me3 on var genes (silencing var genes) [27] . Moreover, subnuclear architecture contributes to the regulation of var gene expression [13] .\\nvar genes are by default silent since they are located at the nuclear periphery [28] . However, active var promoters seem to occupy a privileged expression site of this region, making it permissive to transcribe [21] . PF11_0091, an ApiAP2 member, binds a conserved motif in var introns, mediates episomal anchoring towards the nuclear periphery, and recruiting an actin protein complex and polymerized nuclear actin de-represses silent var genes [29] .\\nOn the other hand, various trans factors are intimately involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene activity. PfAlbas contribute to heterochromatin structure and regulation of var gene expression [30] . PfSIP2, another ApiAP2 member, is involved in the recruitment and organization of subtelomeric heterochromatin through binding to SPE2 [31] , and induces a comprehensive silencing of a var promoter. Particularly, four major classes of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers had been found in P. falciparum, facilitating the spatial and temporal remodeling of chromatin [13] . All these remodeler families consist of a SWI2/SNF2family ATPase subunit featuring an ATPase domain [32, 33] , which includes an HSA (helicase-SANT), a post-HSA, and a C-terminal bromodomain. Some other conserved subunits carry extra conserved domains, such as hBAF155/170 (SANT, SWIRM), hBAF60 (SWIB) and human polybromo (multiple bromodomains). BAF60b is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB, an alternative form of the SWI/SNF complex (Complex B) [34] , while human BAF60a protein of SWI/SNF complex is responsible for facilitating cell cycle halting and has the ability to tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . Recently, a SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, PfSWIB (GenBank: PF3D7_0611400), which is characterized by its SWIB/MDM2 domain (SWI complex, BAF60b domain), has been identified in P. falciparum. PfSWIB might trigger stage-specific PCD by which transient nuclear localization causes removal of these parasites [38] . Further studies revealed that PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . However, it remains unclear whether PfSWIB is involved in transcriptional regulation of virulence gene, especially vars, and its functional properties.\\nTo address the molecular mechanism of PfSWIB, we propose a new conditional knockdown system to study the function and mechanism of chromatin remodeler PfSWIB in regulating var gene expression. We found that the dysfunction of PfSWIB might lead to a significant downregulation of upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in a PfSWIB-knockdown line, as well as the aberrant expression of certain var genes at the mature stage in a single 48-h life-cycle of P. falciparum, which was characterized by the reversion of transcriptional downregulation of upsA and partial upsB/ upsC var genes, suggesting that PfSWIB might play a key role on var gene regulating. In addition, PfSWIB knockdown could affect the growth and development of parasite. This study provides a better understanding of the regulatory function of chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) in regulating the clonal variation of var genes, and an essential insight into the regulation of the major virulence gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.\\nPlasmodium falciparum lines 3D7, PfSWIB and PfSWIB∆ were first thawed and established for continuous cultivation in vitro according to standard procedures [41] . The cultivation was as follows: thawed isolates were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.1 mM hypoxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 20 mg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2% human serum (type AB+; Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China). Cultures were grown in media with type O+ erythrocytes at a 3% hematocrit under 2% O 2 , 5.5% CO 2 , 92.5% N 2 at 37 °C. To obtain tightly synchronized ring stage parasites, a standard percoll/sorbitol synchronization method was performed [42, 43] . In brief, schizonts were isolated over a 40 and 60% percoll cushion and allowed to invade fresh RBCs for 0 to 6 h. The resulting rings were subjected to 5% sorbitol treatment for 5 min at 37 °C. This process was repeated twice. The culture was washed and re-suspended in complete medium containing 2% RBC after the final sorbitol treatment.\\nAll transfected parasite lines originated from the 3D7 clone. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The high fidelity KOD-plus-Neo enzyme (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was used for PCR amplification to detect the endogenous PfSWIB locus or integration of the PfSWIB locus (PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID). PCR amplification reaction conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 32 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and a final extension cycle of 65 °C for 10 min. The specific primers used for PCR are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 .\\npLN-ENR-GFP [44] (GenBank: DQ813653.3) was modified by deleting the whole pfenr-gfp cassette, which was then used to clone various DNA fragments in ApaI/BamHI multicloning site. For the pLN-HA-FKBP-LID construct (6900 bp), the calmodulin promoter (5\\' CaM fragment) was initially substituted by a 1.5 kb C terminus of PfSWIB in the ApaI/ASCI multicloning site. Three duplicates of HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and FKBP-LID tag were ligated towards the C terminus of PfSWIB via a linker sequence (AAAAVDAAAA). The resulting vector pLN-PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID was used to transfect the 3D7 clone. The HA tag consists of three tandem repeat sequences of influenza hemagglutinin, whereas the FKBP-LID tag is comprised of the FK506-and rapamycin-binding protein and a 19-amino-acid degron fused towards the C terminus of FKBP ( Fig. 1a ) [45] .\\nTransfections were performed on synchronized ringstage parasites of 3D7 in a 2 mm BioRad Gene Pulser ® cuvettes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547, USA). A minimum of 100 μg recombinated plasmid DNA was initially purified and used for electroporation using the Bio-Rad GenePulse Xcell ™ electroporator (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547, USA), at 310 V, with a resistance of 950 μF and a transfection time of less than 15 ms. Positive BSD drug selection at the final concentration of 2 nM, was subsequently applied and maintained after the first growth cycle. Those parasites that adopted the pLN-PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID construct carrying the bsd gene would offer a level of resistance to the drug. The transfected parasites were subjected to in vitro culturing for 25 to 40 days and subsequent BSD drug cycling to select stable single-crossover parasites. The initial obtained transfected parasite line was a mixture of the episomal and integrated form. Therefore, a \"3 + 2\" mode of drug screening process was subsequently introduced to enrich the integrated lines. In this process, the original transfected parasites were first cultured in vitro in the absence of BSD for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of culture with BSD (2.5 µg/ml), therefore integrated lines of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID could possibly be further sorted after 2-3 rounds of drug cycling (Fig. 1b) . After two cycles of BSD \"off \" (3 weeks) and BSD \"on\" (2 weeks), PCR was applied to detect the integration events of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID in transfected parasites lines by using specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Primers P2, P4 and P5 are specific to 3\\'UTR of endogenous PfSWIB, the upstream sequence of PfSWIB C-terminus and downstream plasmid sequence of HA-FKBP-LID fusion expression system, respectively, while Fn is the forward primer used for PCR amplification of PfSWIB C-terminus.\\nIn order to obtain purified integrated parasites clones, we utilized a clone screening assay by serial dilution of parasites in 96-well plates, as detailed previously [46] . Two stable transfections of PfSWIB-FKBP-LID integrated parasites clones, PfSWIB-C2 and PfSWIB-B10 were obtained. The integration events were detected on screened clones after extended the culture to 24-well plates. The primers used for testing the clones are described above (see also Additional file 1: Table S1 ). PCR amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 2 min, and a final extension cycle of 65 °C for 10 min.\\nTo analyze the expression of the PfSWIB fusion system in integrated parasites lines, total parasite extracts were prepared by treatment with 0.15% saponin and re-suspended in SDS-loading buffer (Bio-Rad), then separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to western blot analysis. Total proteins from the 3D7 clone were used as controls. An antibody to aldolase (1:1000 dilution; Roche, Indianapolis, USA) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-HA (1:1000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used to identify PfSWIB fusion proteins in different parasite lines. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to develop western blots. The theoretical molecular weight of endogenous PfSWIB, HA tag and HA-FKBP-LID tag is 92kD, 3.5kD and 22kD, respectively. The graylevel image analysis procedure was implemented with ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).\\nSynchronized ring parasites (0-6 h after re-invasion) of the PfSWIB integrated clone (PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID) and the 3D7 clone were collected and diluted to 0.2% parasitemia. Each diluted parasite clone was divided into two wells of parasite cultures in the 24-well plate (50 µl RBC pellets/1 ml medium). Shield1 (0.5 mM (diluted in ethanol); Clontech, Mountain View, USA) was added into one of the two wells (final concentration: 0.5 μM). Consequently, four parasite lines including PfSWIB, PfSWIBΔ, 3D7 (shield1 induced) and 3D7 sh− (shield1 not induced) were subject to in vitro culture for 4-5 days. The parasitemia of each parasite line was counted every 12 h up to 96 h and repeated twice. The rate of parasitemia (%) of different lines were compared statistically by a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni\\'s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Growth curve analysis was performed in triplicate.\\nFor the transcription level assay of individual var genes, we used the var primer pairs published elsewhere [47] and listed in Additional file 2: Table S2 . qPCR assays were performed as described previously [10] . In brief, total RNA of synchronous parasite culture was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [48] . cDNA was prepared in accordance with the manufacturer\\'s recommendations (Thermofisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The fold change between the experimental and reference groups was calculated as 2 −ΔΔCq . qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Singapore) using a program of 1 cycle of 15 s at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, 30 s at 60 °C. Seryl-tRNA synthetase was applied as an endogenous control gene and to normalize the transcriptional level of each var gene. For the qPCR data, statistical significance was determined with the two-tailed Student\\'s t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).\\nRNA-seq was used to screen differentially expressed genes in three parasite lines and was carried out in duplicate. The reference genome and transcript information (P. falciparum 3D7) were obtained from PlasmoDB (http://plasm odb.org/). The RNA-seq aligner STAR v2.5.3a [49] was used to create a genome catalog, based on two data files including a genome sequence fasta file and GFF3 annotation file (PlasmoDB-34_Pfalcipa-rum3D7_Genome.fasta, PlasmoDB-34_Pfalciparum3D7. gff ). FastQC v0.11.5 was subsequently used to analyze the quality of the RNA-seq reads. The qualified reads were subsequently mapped and aligned to the reference genome. Reads with a minimum mapping quality of 20 (− q 20) were further screened out by using SAM tools. Heatmaps of gene expression profiles in different lines were created by using the R package edgeR [50] . Hierarchical clustering was performed by using one minus Pearson\\'s correlation metric and average linkage method. Line plots were generated with ggplot2 [51] . In order to carry out an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-like differential gene expression analysis, a statistical analysis of summarized read counts per genomic feature obtained from feature Counts function [52] was performed by using the R package ALDEx2 [53, 54] . A fold change greater than 1.5 or lower than − 1.5, FDR < 0.05, and P < 0.05 were selected as filters for defining the sets of differentially expressed genes. [44] , which harbored an antibiotic selection marker (bsd for Blasticidin S resistance, pink). HA tags (red) and FKBP-LID tag (blue and green) were ligated towards the 1.5 kb C terminus of PfSWIB. b Drug screening of the PfSWIB fusion expression system. The integration events and expression of PfSWIB modified locus were identified by PCR. \\'BSD+\\' and \\'BSD-\\' indicate that the transfected parasites were cultured in the presence or absence of BSD. Day 24: in vitro culturing in the absence of BSD for 24 days. Day 5, 10 and 15: in vitro culturing in the presence of BSD for 5, 10 and 15 days, respectively. The details of specific primers used for detecting the endogenous, episomal and integrated PfSWIB locus are provided in \"Methods\"\\nDue to the low transfection proficiency after inserting the full-length PfSWIB gene, we subsequently selected a 1.5 kb C terminal sequence of PfSWIB and cloned this into the modified recombinant plasmids pLN-ENR-GFP forming fusion gene expression system pLN-PfSWIB (C-terminus)-HA-FKBP-LID. Through homologous recombination caused by a single crossover event, a transfected parasite clone known as PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID was obtained by transfecting the recombinant plasmid pLN-PfSWIB (C-terminus)-HA-FKBP-LID into the 3D7 strain, which was selected by Blasticidin S deaminase (BSD). The HA tag contains three tandem repeat sequences of influenza hemagglutinin, whereas FKBP-LID tag is comprised of the FK506and rapamycin-binding protein and a 19-amino-acid degron (ligand-induced degradation domain) fused to the C terminus of FKBP (Fig. 1a) [45] . A drug cycling process was subsequently introduced to enrich the integrated lines. The integration events and expression of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID fusion gene were first identified by PCR (Fig. 1b) . The specific primers designed for detecting the transfection proficiency of the PfSWIB modified locus are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 . Additional file 3: Figure S1 shows the screening of integrated clones which were performed by serial dilution and identification of integration events by PCR. Stable transfections of PfSWIB-FKBP-LID integrated parasites clones PfSWIB-C2 and PfSWIB-B10 were finally obtained from the cloning and screening process in 96-well plates. Since the PfSWIB-C2 clone exhibited stability and reproducibility in the subsequent assays, such as PCR detection and qPCR analysis, we selected clone PfSWIB-C2 rather than clone PfSWIB-B10 for the present study.\\nWestern blotting was subsequently performed to detect the expression of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID fusion protein in the presence and absence of shield1 (1:2000, 0.5 μM). According to the previous study, PfSWIB is theoretically stable in the absence of the small molecule shield1 [45] . Alternatively, shield1 binds tightly to FKBP thereby substituting the degron and triggering rapid, continuous degradation of the LID domain and PfSWIB [45] . As shield1 may take time to exert its inhibition function, we selected the in vitro culturing ring and trophozoite parasite stage within their third life-cycle (> 96 h) as testing samples, according to the GCA results (Fig. 2a) . The results indicated that although the PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID (114 kDa) fusion gene could be successfully expressed in both stages in the presence or absence of shield1 (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2a) , there was still a significant difference of PfSWIB fusion protein expression between PfSWIB∆ and PfSWIB lines in the trophozoite stage, the expression of PfSWIB fusion protein decreased in PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394). In contrast, no significant difference had been found in the ring stage parasite (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b, Additional file 4: Figure S2b) .\\nTo study the specific functions of PfSWIB, we subsequently analyzed the growth curve by counting parasitemia of different groups within 96 h (Fig. 2 , Additional file 5: Table S3 ). Both PfSWIB-C2 and 3D7 parasite clones were initially synchronized into 0-6 h ring stage parasites and equally divided into two groups. One group contained shield1 in the culture medium, whereas the other group was lacking shield1. Thus, four groups of lines including PfSWIB∆ (PfSWIB shield1 induced), PfSWIB (PfSWIB sh− shield1 not induced), 3D7 sh+ and 3D7 sh− were subject into the in vitro culture, with exactly the same preliminary parasitemia of 0.2%.\\nThe results of GCA revealed no significant difference in parasitemia between these lines during the first 48 h life-cycle (F (3, 6) \\nBased on the GCA result, we subsequently performed RNA-seq analysis in duplicate with synchronized 0-6 h ring stage parasites of three P. falciparum lines within their third life-cycle, to study the change of expression profiling when knocking down PfSWIB. The scatter plot illustrates the comparison of screening of differentially expressed genes in three parasite lines, including 3D7, PfSWIB and PfSWIB∆ (Additional file 6: Figure S3a ). Among all differentially expressed genes, 112 and 450 were upregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line when compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 line, respectively, whereas 1 and 616 genes were downregulated (fold change, FC > 1.5, P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05). We further performed hierarchical clustering of the individual gene expression profiles by using the R package edgeR. RNA-seq data were normalized for sequencing depth and gene length using log 2 -transformed FPKM values (Additional file 6: Figure  S3b ). According to the special characteristics of differentially expressed proteins in each line, we further screened out transcription factors such as PfApiAP2 family and PfSir2B, as well as certain histone modification enzymes, which proved to be involved in regulating on var gene transcription. These genes were significantly upregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line, suggesting the existence of their different transcription profiling when knocking down PfSWIB. In addition, a number of vars also exhibited differential expression among different lines (Additional file 2: Table S2 ).\\nTo further study the transcription patterns of upsA-, upsB-and upsC-subtype var genes in different parasite lines, we first selected 44 differentially expressed vars among different lines based on the RNA-seq results (fold change, FC > 1.5, P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05), and tested the expression patterns of these preferred vars in each comparison group at the ring stage (0-10 h after re-invasion in 3rd life-cycle, > 96 h) by real-time PCR (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). upsB or upsA corresponds to subtelomeric and upsC corresponds to chromosome internal var gene members [55, 56] . Figure 3 shows the fold change of var gene expression profiling between shield1 pre-and post-induced lines PfSWIB∆ vs PfSWIB. Most upsA-and upsC-type vars were significantly downregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line, especially the upsA vars, when compared to the PfSWIB line (Fig. 3 , Additional file 7: Figure S4 ). However, the expression pattern of partial upsB vars presented a distinct change in the PfSWIB∆ line. A group of 9 upsB vars exhibited a high level of expression (Fig. 3 , red asterisk) (fold change ≥ 2.0, P < 0.05), while 5 upsB vars present an extremely low expression level (Fig. 3 , black asterisk) (fold change ≤ − 2.0, P < 0.05), when compared the PfSWIB∆ line to other lines.\\nWe subsequently re-analyzed the RNA-seq results of vars in these lines by using the R package edgeR, to identify similarities and differences in expression patterns for different var variants. The heatmap representing the hierarchical clustering of the var genes is shown in Fig. 4 and Additional file 8: Figure S5 . Figure 4 indicates two major clusters of 44 selected vars in relation to the expression pattern: one major cluster consisting of 37 var variants covered most of upsA, upsB and all upsC vars, while the other cluster covered only 5 upsB and 2 upsA vars. In addition, there were 24 and 20 vars variants showed an expression maximum in the 3D7 line and PfSWIB∆ line, respectively (red box). Additional linear regression analysis of the correlation between qPCR and RNA-seq data was performed to investigate the transcriptome data accuracy on 44 var genes (Additional file 9: Figure S6 , Additional file 10: Table S4 ). In the PfSWIB vs PfSWIB∆ comparison, the qPCR data showed a significant linear correlation with the RNA-seq data (r (44) = 0.6281, P < 0.0001). The RNA-seq results of 9 upregulated and 5 downregulated upsB vars (described above by qPCR analysis in the PfSWIB∆ line), were also re-analyzed by computing the log 2 fold change of FPKM values in different lines. Of these, 5 out of 9 upregulated upsB vars (except for PF3D7_1300100, PF3D7_1200100, PF3D7_0900100 and PF3D7_0712300) (Fig. 4, red arrow) , and 4 out of 5 downregulated (except for PF3D7_1240300) (Fig. 4 , black arrow) showed consistency with the qPCR results. Additional file 8: Figure S5 shows the expression pattern and hierarchical clustering of all the 60 vars in the three lines.\\nAccording to previous studies, var genes were highly expressed in the ring stage, while drastically downregulated in the trophozoite stage [6, 10, 11] . To confirm this, we initially collected RNA samples from the ring and trophozoite stages of the 3D7 clone within the third . Approximately all of the var genes, were downregulated at the mature stage of 3D7 sh+ and 3D7 sh− parasite lines, except for PF3D7-0632500 (upsA), and PF3D7_1219300 and PF3D7_0712900 (upsB), suggesting that shield1 may have no influence on the expression of most var genes in a single 48 hour-life cycle of P. falciparum (Additional file 11: Figure S7) .\\nWe subsequently analyzed the log 2 ratio of T/R in invitro cultured PfSWIB∆ and PfSWIB lines within their third life-cycle after collecting RNA samples from their synchronized ring and trophozoite parasites. Among these parasite lines, PfSWIB exhibited a quite similar log 2 ratio of T/R to 3D7, which was characterized by the downregulation of most var genes at the mature stage (Fig. 5) . In contrast, approximately all of the upsA vars, as well as partial upsB (PF3D7_1200400, PF3D7_0632500, PF3D7_1219300, PF3D7_1240300 and PF3D7_1240400) and upsC (PF3D7_0412900, PF3D7_0420900 and PF3D7_0617400) vars were activated at the mature stage of P. falciparum in the PfSWIB∆ line (Fig. 5 ).\\nThe interplay between altered histone modification, chromatin modifying machinery, and general or sequence-specific transcription factors results in var gene regulation by modulating chromatin structure [57] . In this process, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling through removal and movements of nucleosomes and deposition of alternative histones [13] . There are at least 11 proteins containing putative SWI2/SNF2 ATPase catalytic domains in P. falciparum [58] , seven of which are predicted to be chromatin-modifying proteins, including ISWI, Swr1, CHD1, SNF2L, MAL8P1.65, PFB0730w, PFF0225w and PF13_0308 [18] . However, it remains unclear how these PfCRCs regulate var gene expression by remodeling certain chromatin and therefore resulting in a high level of antigenic variation, immunity evasion and pathopoiesis.\\nThe SWI/SNF complex, originally revealed in yeasts, allows for transcriptional activation by remodeling chromatin [59] . It has also been demonstrated previously that mammalian SWI/SNF homologs complexes, also known as BRG1-associated factors (BAFs), can be found in multiple forms which consist of 9-12 proteins. Among these BAFs, BAF60b exists in an alternative form of the SWI/ SNF complex (Complex B), which is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB [34] . In humans, the BAF60a protein of the SWI/SNF complex is responsible for p53 binding and regulates its activities via an N-terminal region of the SWIB/MDM2 domain [35] , as well as facilitating cell cycle halting and tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . SWIB/MDM2 domains have in fact been shown to participate in protein-protein [60] and chromatin-related interactions [61] , but their functional roles in other species are poorly understood. Similarly, the SWI/SNF complex is composed of constant units and includes the Swp73p/SNF12 protein comprising a SWIB/MDM2 domain, proposed to facilitate specificity and/or functionality to some extent [38, 62] . According to recent studies, the P. falciparum genome encodes two putative SWIB/MDM2 domain-containing proteins: PfMDM2 (PF3D70518200, SWIB/MDM2 domaincontaining protein) and PfSWIB (PF3D70611400, SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin) [38] , and PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but additionally had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that PfSWIB is characterized by its SWIB domain (BAF60b domain, PlasmoDB, http://plasm odb. org/). Bonger et al. [45] have recently developed a new technique by which the degradation of a specific protein is definitely induced by way of a small molecule, shield1. Hence, an in-depth functional analysis of PfSWIB based on the conditional knock-down assay was implemented in the present study. By using a transgenic assay, drug screening and subsequent screening of the clones, we obtained two integrated parasite clones PfSWIB-C2 and B10, with a stable transfection of the modified locus PfSWIB-FKBP-LID into the Plasmodium parasites (Fig. 1 , Additional file 3: Figure S1 ). Western blot analysis confirmed that the fusion expression protein was successfully expressed in the transfected parasite lines, and there was a significant decrease of PfSWIB fusion protein expression in the PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394), at its trophozoite stage within third life-cycle of P. falciparum. However, it should be noted that no significant change was detected in the protein expression level of PfSWIB fusion system during the ring stage, either in the presence or absence of drug pressure (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). This could be due to at least two reasons. First, it takes time for shield1 to work at full capacity through binding to LID, therefore, a portion or slight loss of fused PfSWIB protein could not be identified. Secondly, this protein might be expressed predominantly at the mature stage of P. falciparum.\\nIt is worth noting that PfSWIB may lead to stage-specific PCD, in the same way as BAF60a of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex induces p53-directed apoptosis, by which transient nuclear localization results in removal of these parasites, as previously described [35] . Vieira et al. [38] further demonstrated that PfSWIB could have a stage-specific, pro-survival function and takes part in the heat stress response of the Plasmodium parasite. They discovered that PfSWIB and PfARK3 participate in preventing p53-mediated apoptosis within the nucleus in reaction to heat stress [38] . Alternatively, human Aurora kinase B and its yeast homologue play key roles during gene transcription through histone H3 phosphorylation [39, 40] . Likewise, PfSWIB could also have an effect on parasite survival through transcriptional regulation by guiding the PfARK3\\'s phosphorylation activities [39, 40] . In our study, growth curve analysis of P. falciparum revealed that a relatively low parasitemia was observed in the PfSWIB knockdown line (PfSWIB∆) when compared to other parasite lines during their second life-cycle. Significant change was observed after 96 hours, when the parasites developed into the third life-cycle. The parasitemia of PfSWIB∆ showed a sharp decline (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that PfSWIB might play a key role in the proliferation and survival of P. falciparum.\\nOn the other hand, Jiang et al. [27] proved that knocking out the P. falciparum variant-silencing SET gene, which encodes an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster ASH1 and controls histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) on var genes, leads to expression of all vars. In another study focused on a novel chromatin-associated exoribonuclease, termed PfRNase II, Zhang et al. [63] revealed that this PfRNase II controls the silencing of upsA var genes, by marking their transcription start site and intron promoter regions leading to short-lived cryptic RNA. Depletion of PfRNase II specifically removes the silencing of upsA vars. Similarly, in the present study, knocking down of PfSWIB results in the silencing of upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB vars (Fig. 3 , Additional file 7: Figure S4 ). Therefore, PfSWIB might be one of the trans factors activating var genes, especially the upsA vars, and silencing partial upsB vars. In addition, a few var genes exhibited inconsistent RNA-seq results with qPCR, especially the upsA vars. They are more likely to be conditionally activated in the PfSWIB knockdown line, according to the RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 4 , Additional file 8: Figure  S5 ). The minor inconsistency between the RNA-seq and the qPCR results for partial vars could be due to false positives/negatives resulting from either of these two methods, or experimental variation caused by different parasite lines or other unidentified factors. Nevertheless, by comparing the log 2 fold change data from qPCR and RNA-seq on 44 var genes, we confirmed that the linear regression and linear correlation analysis showed a significant linear correlation between the two methods (r (44) =v0.6281, P < 0.0001) (Additional file 9: Figure S6) .\\nFurthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that var genes were highly expressed in the ring stage of P. falciparum, while drastically downregulated in the trophozoite stage. The var transcriptional levels in trophozoites are usually 10-100 times less than those in rings [6, 7, 10, 11] . A single P. falciparum parasite simultaneously transcribes multiple var genes but selects only one PfEMP-1 to attain the surface of the host cell by way of a developmentally regulated process [6, 7] . In order to test whether the transcription pattern had been disrupted when knocking down PfSWIB, we subsequently compared the transcription level of selected var genes between ring and trophozoite stage parasites, by testing the log 2 fold change of T/R in each group during a single life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5 , Additional file 11: Figure S7 ). Strikingly, we discovered that most of the upsA, upsB and upsC vars were downregulated in PfSWIB and 3D7 lines, while virtually all the upsA vars and partial upsB/upsC vars were significantly upregulated at the trophozoite-stage of the PfSWIB∆ line within the third life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5) , suggesting that PfSWIB might be involved in temporal regulation of var genes, particularly group A vars. The dysfunction of PfSWIB could disrupt the interactions between PfSWIB and other transcription factors which are essential for gene silencing or inhibit PfSWIB activity through unknown mechanisms.\\nAs we mentioned previously, P. falciparum varies its surface protein expression, particularly the var gene family-encoded clonally variant surface protein expression, to evade host immune responses [6] . In the process of monoallelic expression, specific silent var genes are usually retained at unique perinuclear sites and relocated to transcriptionally active zones [21, 28] . Nuclear actin has been discovered complexed with PfSET10, which has been suggested to play a role in the movement of the locus during activation and heterochromatic silencing [26, 29] . Actin and actin-related proteins (Arps) are common components of chromatin remodeling complexes and are involved in nuclear positioning. According to biological characteristics, PfSWIB may be involved in the process of relocating episomes, as an actin-dependent regulator of chromatin. Further studies regarding the possible role of PfSWIB and actin interaction would be worthwhile.\\nIn the present study, we revealed that actin-related chromatin remodeling factor PfSWIB is involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and is crucial for the survival and growth of the Plasmodium parasite. Depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes and removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes, but also leads to the aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-hour life-cycle. These findings could provide a better understanding of the regulatory function of PfCRCs in regulating the clonal variation of the var gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.', 'Recovery of muscle tissue damaged by diseases or injuries is a complex process. If a massive amount of muscle tissue is lost, the intrinsic regeneration potential of skeletal muscles cannot provide the complete healing of the lesion [1] . Moreover, muscle weakness, muscular dystrophy, and impaired physical mobility are characteristic of genetically heterogeneous myodystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy [2] . Pathogenic variations in the dystrophin gene underlie Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This disease is the most common childhood muscular dystrophy, affecting 1:5000 live male births [3] . Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is the second most prevalent dystrophy after Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and affects approximately 870,000 people worldwide [4] . Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy results from the inappropriate expression of a gene called Double Homeobox 4 (DUX4) [5] . Congenital myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of approx. 1:48,000 live births [6] . There is no treatment for these diseases. Today, methods aimed at the symptomatic correction are physiotherapy and administration of steroids, anticonvulsants, and immunosuppressant drugs. Cellular therapy is a perspective for substituting damaged tissue that makes stem cells a promising instrument for regenerative treatment of myodystrophies and post-traumatic injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be attractive for this purpose due to the simplicity of isolation, high migration capacity, relatively high expansion rate, and few allogeneic reactions caused by transplantation [7, 8] .\\nMyogenic MSC differentiation is caused by activating the sequential expression of transcription of specific myogenic transcription factors such as MYOD, MYF5, myogenin, and MRF4 ( Figure 1 ) [9] [10] [11] , which are also involved in post-traumatic muscle tissue repair [11] . The progression of activated progenitor cells towards the myogenic lineage in the early stages is mainly controlled by the expression of the MYF5 and MYOD genes [12] . The MYF5 gene is activated in the early differentiation period; however, the mRNA level can remain elevated during the entire differentiation process, decreasing only in the late period [10, 13] . MYF5 is considered a key gene for the initiation of myogenic differentiation [12, [14] [15] [16] . Expression of the MYOD gene is initiated shortly after an increase in the MYF5 gene transcription [17, 18] . In proliferating myoblasts, the MYOD gene is transcribed through a TFIID-dependent mechanism, in which a moderate level of expression is provided due to spatial localization near the nuclear periphery [19, 20] . As myoblasts initiate differentiation towards the myotubes, the MYOD gene moves into the nucleus, where the TAF3/TRF3-dependent transcription mechanism leads to a high-level MYOD expression [19, 20] . MYOD controls the early gene expression in differentiation: adhesion and cell-matrix molecules, intermediate transcription factor genes, and late genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins [21] . MYOD activates transcription activity in previously \"silent\" loci, acting as a \"master switch\" gene, which contributes to the transformation of cells of different lines and differentiation stages into skeletal muscle cells [21] . It was shown that there are functional differences inherent in members of the MRF family and their specific spatial and temporal expression patterns during development [14] . The genomewide binding analysis demonstrated that MYOD and MYF5 share a significant proportion of their targets in proliferating myoblasts [22] . Cross-interactions between the MYOD and MYF5 genes also differ in humans and mice. Knockdown of MYOD1 in human skeletal muscle stem cells does not affect MYF5 expression. However, MYF5 directly or indirectly enhances MYOD1 expression [13] . In murine stem cells, knockdown of MYOD1 leads to an increase in the expression of the MYF5 protein [23] .\\nAn increased MYOD expression stimulates the MYOG expression, which leads to lowering MYF5 expression [24] . This transition of expression from MYF5 to MYOG coincides with the exit from the cell cycle and the exit of the cell into a differentiated state [14, 25, 26] . MYOD and MYF5 are usually considered factors involved in identifying myogenic cells, while MYOG and MRF4 are more strongly associated with terminal differentiation and myofiber homeostasis [21] . The molecular characterization of two transcription factors, MYOD and MYOG, suggests an essential difference between these factors. MYOD establishes an open chromatin structure in muscle-specific genes, while MYOG provides high levels of gene transcription in this open chromatin state [14, 27] . Both in vitro and in vivo, myogenin expression precedes the terminal differentiation of stem cells and controls the synthesis of proteins that make up the contractile apparatus of cells [28] .\\nThe joint activity of MYOD and MYOG leads to the expression of the MRF4 gene and other genes of late muscle differentiation, which allows the formation of multinucleated fibers. In mature muscle fibers, the expression of MYOD and MYOG decreases, while MRF4 continues to be expressed at high levels, acting as the predominant MRF in adult muscle [29] . MRF4 is a marker of the late period of muscle differentiation. MRF4 is responsible for the terminal differentiation of muscle fibers [30] .\\nVarious biochemical pathways regulate myogenic differentiation. The growth factors TGF-β and FGF, and transcription factors STAT2 and STAT3, are involved in regulating myogenic differentiation [31, 32] . Autophagy is another regulator of myogenic differentiation in MSCs [33] . Autophagy is mediated by the LC3 and BECN1 genes [33] . Functionalized fullerenes have biochemical effects on stem cells. Fullerenol/alginate hydrogel can effectively decrease the reactive oxygen species level in the myocardial infarction zone, improve the retention and survival of implanted brown-adipose-derived stem cells, and induce angiogenesis. Moreover, fullerenol can improve the cardiomyogenic differentiation of brown-adipose-derived stem cells [35] . Fullerene C 60 improves the MAPK expression level and brown-adipose-derived stem cell survival and proliferation, and modulates cardiomyogenic differentiation. In addition, fullerene C 60 promotes the formation of a gap junction among cells [36] . The anti-aging effect of fullerenol on skin aging through derived stem cells in a mouse model was demonstrated by Li et al. [37] . Fullerenol inhibited the crosstalk between bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and tumor cells by regulating MAPK signaling [38] .\\nThus, studies on the effects of fullerenes and their derivatives on the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells are very promising, but not numerous. We have not been able to find information on water-soluble fullerenes as inducers of myogenic differentiation in stem cells. We have previously demonstrated the increased expression of some myogenic differentiation factors in MSCs by a water-soluble phosphonate C 60 derivative [39] . Here, we have studied in detail the effect of this compound compared to two other phosphoruscontaining compounds on autophagy and the expression of myogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic transcription factors in human adipose-derived MSCs.\\nThe effect of three phosphorus-containing water-soluble derivatives of C 60 fullerene on MSCs obtained from different donors was studied. The molecular structures of the fullerenes (F1, F2, and F3) are shown in Figure 2 .\\nThe standard MTT test was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the fullerenes. The maximum nontoxic concentrations were as high as 175 µM for F1, 200 µM for F2, and 295 µM for F3.\\nWe have previously shown that aqueous solutions of C 60 derivatives exhibit dark-red fluorescence in the range of 600-950 nm excited by a wide wavelength range (from 300 to 600 nm) [40] [41] [42] , which makes it possible to analyze their distribution in cells. Within 3-24 h after adding to the cells, F1 (170 µM), F2 (195 µM), and F3 (290 µM) permeated into MSCs as the fluorescence intensity increased by a factor of 1.5-2 ( Figure 3a ). The maximum fluorescence was detected in 24 h. A longer incubation time did not significantly influence the permeation of the fullerenes into the cells. We examined the effect of water-soluble C60 fullerene derivatives F1, F2, and F3 in two concentrations on the expression of both genes and proteins. F1 was taken at concentrations of 398 nM and 170 μM; F2 was taken at concentrations of 456 nM and 195 μM; The intracellular distribution of the fullerenes was visualized as dark-red fluorescence (λ ex = 350 nm). Figure 3b shows the fluorescence image of F2 localizing in the cells after 24 h of incubation.\\nWe examined the effect of water-soluble C 60 fullerene derivatives F1, F2, and F3 in two concentrations on the expression of both genes and proteins. F1 was taken at concentrations of 398 nM and 170 µM; F2 was taken at concentrations of 456 nM and 195 µM; and F3 was taken at concentrations of 679 nM and 290 µM. The micromolar concentrations were chosen based on the MTT test. These are the maximum nontoxic concentrations for stem cells. The nanomolar concentrations were 427 times lower than the maximum nontoxic concentrations of the studied substances. The fullerenes at these concentrations still affected the gene expression. At lower concentrations, there was no effect on the cells.\\nEach of the three tested compounds activated MYF5 gene expression to varying degrees. F3 at concentrations of 679 nM and 290 µM stimulated the expression of the MYF5 gene by a factor of 1.8-2.3 (p < 0.01) after 24-72 h of incubation. After 7 days, the MYF5 expression decreased to the blank level ( Figure 4a ). F1 at concentrations of 398 nM and 170 µM stimulated the expression of the MYF5 gene by a factor of 3-3.7 (p < 0.01) and 1.8-2.3 (p < 0.01), respectively, after 24-72 h of incubation. After 7 days, the MYF5 expression remained 1.5 times higher than the blank value (p < 0.01). After 14 days, the MYF5 expression returned to the blank value. F2 caused the most significant changes in the transcriptional activity of the MYF5 gene. After 24-72 h of incubation with 456 nM, the MYF5 expression increased by a factor of 4.8-5.3 (p < 0.01). After 24-72 h of incubation with 195 µM, the MYF5 expression increased by a factor of 6.0-9.0 (p < 0.01). After 7 and 14 days, the MYF5 expression remained increased by a factor of 2.6-2.9 (p < 0.01) for 456 nM and 6.7-6.9 (p < 0.01) for 195 µM (Figure 4a ).\\nThe activity of MYF5 gene increases in the early differentiation period; however, the mRNA level can remain elevated during the entire differentiation process, decreasing only in the late period [10, 13] . Some researchers have reported a decrease in the MYF5 protein expression during cell-cycle progression due to proteolytic degradation [43, 44] , associated with the termination of proliferative signals. However, F2, in contrast to F1 and F3, activates MYF5 transcription in MSCs for a long period of time, which contributes to the prolonged differentiation and an increase in the expression of the MYF5 transcription factor. As a result of the activation of the MYF5 transcriptional activity, rapid translation of MYF5 mRNA occurs [45] .\\nIn line with the above, an increase in the MYF5 gene expression led to increased MYF5 protein expression. After 7 days of incubation with F1 at concentrations of 398 nM and 170 µM or F3 at a concentration of 290 µM, the MYF5 protein expression increased by a factor of 1.5-2.9 (p < 0.01). After 14 days, the MYF5 protein expression decreased to the blank level ( Figure 4b ). After 7-14 days of incubation with F2 at concentrations of 456 nM and 195 µM, the MYF5 protein expression increased by a factor of 2.5-4.0 (p < 0.01) and 4.0-7.0 (p < 0.01), respectively ( Figure 4b ).\\nAll three tested compounds stimulated the MYOD1 gene expression to varying degrees. After 3-7 days of incubation with F3 (290 µM), the expression level of the MYOD1 gene increased by a factor of 1.5-2.0 (p < 0.01). After 14 days, the MYOD1 gene expression decreased to the blank values. At a concentration of 679 nM, F3 did not significantly affect the MYOD1 gene expression (Figure 5a ).\\nAfter 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days of incubation with F1 (170 µM), the MYOD1 gene expression increased by a factor of 1.5, 3.2, and 6.2 (p < 0.01 in all cases), respectively. After 14 days, the MYOD1 gene expression remained 1.5 times higher than the blank value Thus, F2 activated the MYOD1 gene for two weeks, which allowed it to bind to regulatory elements expressed at the early and late stages of differentiation [34] . Our results demonstrate a long-term increased level of MYOD1 mRNA during differentiation in the presence of F2, which coincided with the previously obtained data [34, 46] .\\nThe MYOD protein expression was not significantly increased after 1-4 days of incubation with F1 (398 nM and 170 µM) (Figure 5b ), while the MYOD1 gene expression was high. This phenomenon possibly resulted from the fast degradation of the protein, which was in agreement with the previously obtained data [10, 47] . Degradation of MYOD may be associated with cell-cycle progression [48] and regulated by lysine 133, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of MYOD [48] .\\nThe MYOG gene expression increased approximately 1.5 times (p < 0.01) after 3 days of incubation with F1 (170 µM). After 7 days, the MYOG gene expression decreased, reaching the blank level after 14 days (Figure 6a ). F3 (679 nM and 290 µM) and F1 (398 nM) did not cause a statistically significant increase in the MYOG gene expression (Figure 6a ). Unlike F1 and F3, F2 (456 nM and 195 µM) significantly affected the MYOG gene expression. After 3-14 days, the MYOG gene expression increased by a factor of 1.9-2.9 (p < 0.01) (Figure 6a ). Thus, F2 in the concentration range of 456 nM-195 µM stimulated the differentiation towards the myogenic lineage in human mesenchymal stem cells. The two other studied phosphorus-containing compounds also stimulated the transcriptional activity of myogenic differentiation genes, but they could not promote the differentiation of stem cells to the terminal stage. Despite the activation of transcription and translation of the MYF5 and MYOD genes by F1 and F3, these compounds did not activate the transcriptional activity of the MYOG gene, which led to no effect on the expression of the MRF4 gene and, apparently, other genes of late muscle differentiation.\\nSince F2 stimulated the expression of main genes of myogenic differentiation, and F1 and F3 activated the transcription of genes for initial myogenic differentiation, we studied the expression of genes for adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. [9] or the respective proteins (Figure 11a,b) . After 14 days, incubation with F1 (398 nM and 170 µM) resulted in a slight increase in the expression of CEBPB, LPL, and AP2 (FABP4) genes, which may indicate either a switch of myogenic differentiation towards an adipogenic one or activation of adipogenic differentiation in a fraction of the MSC population. Fourteen days of incubation with F2 (456 nM and 195 µM) resulted in a significant decrease in the FABP4 protein, in parallel with an increase in the MYOD protein (Figure 5b ). either the adipogenic differentiation genes CEBPB, LPL, and AP2 (FABP4) [9] or the respective proteins (Figure 11a,b) . After 14 days, incubation with F1 (398 nM and 170 μM) resulted in a slight increase in the expression of CEBPB, LPL, and AP2 (FABP4) genes, which may indicate either a switch of myogenic differentiation towards an adipogenic one or activation of adipogenic differentiation in a fraction of the MSC population. Fourteen days of incubation with F2 (456 nM and 195 μM) resulted in a significant decrease in the FABP4 protein, in parallel with an increase in the MYOD protein (Figure 5b ).\\n(a) (b) Figure 11 .

The gene RNA amount was the mean value for three experiments related to the blank; the TBP gene was used as an internal reference gene; FL1 values were calculated for three experiments related to the blank; (*) denotes significant differences compared to blank cells, p < 0.005, in a Mann-Whitney test. In blank experiments, cells were incubated without the fullerenes.\\nH2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are of great importance in the functioning of cells. ROS at low concentrations regulate the cell cycle, protein kinase activity, and gene expression. An increase in ROS synthesis leads to the development of oxidative stress in cells [46] . Effective antioxidants can reduce the delay in stem-cell differentiation in the myogenic direction caused by oxidative stress by removing reactive oxygen species [51] .\\nTo study the effects of F1, F2, and F3 on intracellular ROS, we used H2DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate or 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate), which permeates through the cell membrane and undergoes deacetylation by intracellular esterases [52] . In the cytosol, nonfluorescent dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) is a sensitive intracellular marker of oxidative stress during its oxidation to dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by various ROS radicals; DCFH oxidation is nonspecific, and the DCF signal in cells reflects the overall amount of ROS [53] . ROS was detected by flow cytometry assay.\\nAfter 1 to 3 h of incubation with F1 (170 μM), the ROS amount decreased significantly, by 40-42% (p < 0.01). After 24 h, the ROS level remained lowered; after 72 h, it [46] . Effective antioxidants can reduce the delay in stem-cell differentiation in the myogenic direction caused by oxidative stress by removing reactive oxygen species [51] .\\nTo study the effects of F1, F2, and F3 on intracellular ROS, we used H2DCFH-DA (2,7dichlorofluorescein diacetate or 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate), which permeates through the cell membrane and undergoes deacetylation by intracellular esterases [52] .

ROS was detected by flow cytometry assay. After 1 to 3 h of incubation with F1 (170 µM), the ROS amount decreased significantly, by 40-42% (p < 0.01). After 24 h, the ROS level remained lowered; after 72 h, it increased by 43-47% (p < 0.01). A similar but less marked tendency was found for F1 at a concentration of 398 nM ( Figure 12 ). After 1 h of incubation with F2 (195 µM), the ROS amount increased by 40-45% (p < 0.01). After 3 h, the ROS level decreased lower than the blank values. After 24 h, intracellular ROS significantly decreased and remained lowered by 38-42% (p < 0.01). A similar but less marked tendency was found for F2 at a concentration of 456 nM. The decrease in ROS as a result of F2 action (456 nM) within 24-72 h was statistically significant (p < 0.01) ( Figure 12 ). The decrease in the ROS level in MSCs under F2 action may be associated with its penetration into the MSC cytoplasm after 24 h of incubation.\\nAfter 1 h of incubation with F3 (290 µM), there was a significant decrease in the ROS level, by 30-38% (p < 0.01). After 3 h, the ROS level increased slightly, and after 24-72 h, it returned to the blank values. A similar but not so marked tendency was observed for F3 at a concentration of 679 nM ( Figure 12 ).\\nAfter 7 days of incubation with F2 (456 nM), the expression of the LC3 gene and the LC3 protein increased by a factor of 4.0-4.2 (p < 0.01), and the BECN1 gene and BECN1 protein by a factor of 1.5-2.0 (p < 0.01) (Figure 13a,b) . The activation of the expression of genes and proteins involved in autophagy was even more marked under the action of F2 at a concentration of 195 µM. After 7 days, the expression of the LC3 gene and the LC3 protein increased by a factor of 5.0-5.8 (p < 0.01), and the BECN1 gene and BECN1 protein by a factor of 7.2-8.0 (p < 0.01) (Figure 13a,b) . The results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. When MSCs were stained with antibodies to LC3, the number of LC3-positive cells increased, and the fluorescence of antibodies increased after 14 days of incubation with F2 at a concentration of 195 µM (Figure 13d) . Incubation of MSCs with F1 (398 nM and 170 µM) and F3 (679 nM and 290 µM) for 7-14 days did not stimulate the expression of either LC3 autophagy gene or the LC3 protein (Figure 13c) .\\nThus, the stimulation of autophagy may be another factor contributing to the activation of the expression of factors of myogenic differentiation in MSCs by F2. \\nWhen studying the differentiation of MSCs, we assumed that not all cells in the population could be differentiated under the influence of the fullerenes. Therefore, we used the flow cytometry method, as it provided not only the total amount of proteins, but also the percentage of cells in which protein expression had changed. In addition, the data were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. The photographs demonstrate that the fluorescence did not increase in all cells. However, the total protein expression significantly increased; this allowed us to consider the stimulus of F2 quite effective.\\nAll studied compounds were fullerenes C60, modified with five phosphonic acid residues. They differed from each other in substituents at the P-O bond. Compound F2 was C60 pentaphoshonate potassium salt, F1 was pentadimethylphosphonate, and F3 was pentamethoxyethyl phosphonate. Thus, F2 was an acid anion, and the other two compounds were esters. These compounds have comparable toxicity (0.2-0.3 mM), but the biological activity of F2 concerning the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells differs significantly from that of F1 and F3. While the latter two fullerenes activate only the early genes of myogenic differentiation, and F1 is a slightly more effective stimulus than F3, F2 activates the genes of the entire myogenic differentiation pathway. None of the compounds affected the pathway of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. In addition, F2 turned out to be an inducer of autophagy. These results are summarized in Table 1 . \\nWhen studying the differentiation of MSCs, we assumed that not all cells in the population could be differentiated under the influence of the fullerenes.

None of the compounds affected the pathway of osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation. In addition, F2 turned out to be an inducer of autophagy. These results are summarized in Table 1 . It was essential to compare the effects of F2 fullerene with a conventional inducer of myogenic differentiation. We performed such experiments with a standard myogenic differentiation kit (a positive control). The F2-induced expression of genes and proteins involved in myogenic differentiation was comparable with the positive control. There were minor differences between the expression of early genes of myogenic differentiation. At 7 and 14 days, the expression of MYOD, MYOG, and MRF4 genes and proteins was almost the same for F2 and the positive control, while the expression of MYF5 gene and protein was increased for F2-induced stimulation, but not for the positive control ( Figure A1 , Table A1 ). This may be probably due to a different mechanism of activation of the transcriptional activity of genes, which was shown, for example, by Mizuno et al. [54] .\\nThus, the differentiation stimulated by F2 reached late stages, which opened prospects for further study and searches for similar derivatives with higher differentiation potential. The phenomenon of the induction of differentiation towards the muscle lineage by phosphorous-containing derivatives, in our opinion, can be considered as a new significant fact that requires description and discussion.\\nConclusions about all possible mechanisms of triggering autophagy and myogenic differentiation cannot be made without specific experiments. Here, we only discuss the relationship between MSC differentiation, autophagy, and ROS disbalance.\\nAdipose-derived MSCs represent an attractive cell type for medical applications, as they can be isolated readily from fat [55, 56] . Adipose-derived stem cells can differentiate towards osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis [55, 57] . Their ability to undergo myogenesis, however, appears to be contradictory. MSCs have immunomodulatory/immunoregulatory activity, which is provided both by direct intercellular contacts and due to the expression and secretion of many molecules with immunomodulatory properties [58] . Immunomodulation and secretion of growth factors by MSCs provide the potential of MSC-based cell therapy [59] . The use of MSCs as immunomodulators has been explored in transplantation [60, 61] , tissue repair [62] , treatment of autoimmune diseases [63] , asthma [64] , prevention of graft vs. host disease, and even for treatment of COVID-19 [65] . The regenerative and reparative potential of MSC-based therapy was developed for the treatment of aging frailty [66] , liver cirrhosis [67] and fibrosis [68] , cu-taneous wounds [69] , heart failure [70] , ischemic stroke [71] , and in many other cases. However, despite these positive results, there is still a problem with the potential of MSCs to promote tumorigenesis [72] .\\nAs for muscular dystrophies, in contrast to other cell-based therapies, MSCs have the advantages of (a) the ability to fuse with and genetically complement dystrophic muscle; (b) possessing anti-inflammatory activities; and (c) producing trophic factors that may augment the activity of endogenous repair cells [73] . Goncalves et al. demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells ectopically expressing full-length dystrophin could complement Duchenne muscular dystrophy myotubes by cell fusion [74] . Siemionow et al. developed dystrophin-expressing chimeric human cells of myoblast/mesenchymal stem cell origin for transplantation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy [75] . Intramuscular injection of nonautologous MSCs can be safely used to treat dystrophic muscle in immunocompetent hosts without inflaming the host immune system [76] . The review [77] summarizes data on MSCbased therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were successfully applied in the safe and efficient treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in India [78] . Human adipose-derived CD146(+) stem cells increased the life span of a muscular dystrophy mouse model more efficiently than mesenchymal stromal cells, possibly due to immunomodulatory and angiogenic properties [79] . Administration of microfragmented fat in key muscles improved muscular phenotype (decreased necrosis and fibrosis), decreased inflammatory cytokines, and increased strength in a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [80] .\\nMSCs are known to have low levels of intracellular ROS and high levels of glutathione. Increasing evidence implicates a tight regulation of differentiation by reactive oxygen species. ROS interact with several differentiation pathways, such as the Wnt, Hedgehog, and FOXO signaling cascades. On the other hand, oxidative stress leads to the arrest of the MSC cell cycle and apoptosis. Tightly regulated levels of ROS are therefore critical for MSC terminal differentiation, although the precise sources, localization, levels, and the exact species of ROS implicated remain to be determined [81] .\\nROS primarily stimulate the expression of genes associated with adipogenesis and favor human MSC differentiation into mature adipocytes. Moreover, adipocytes contain higher levels of intracellular ROS compared with progenitors [81] . ROS regulate adipocyte differentiation of MSCs by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ,) while the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine acts through ROS to inhibit adipocyte differentiation [82] . The hypoxia-induced increase in mitochondrial ROS stimulated adipocyte differentiation via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [83] .\\nBesides mitochondria, NADPH oxidases (NOX) are a major source of ROS. Knockdown of NOX4 inhibited ROS production and adipocyte differentiation by differentiationinducing agents. Thus, the increase in the intracellular ROS level via NOX4 mediates adipocyte differentiation in MSC [84] .\\nIt is believed that ROS suppress osteoblast differentiation, and antioxidants could potentially neutralize this effect [81] . To prove this statement, the researchers investigated the osteogenic differentiation effect of resveratrol on senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells and the involvement of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/(ROS) signaling pathway. As a result, osteogenic-related gene expression was significantly enhanced after resveratrol treatment. ROS production in the cells was inhibited, while AMPK expression was upregulated by resveratrol [85] .\\nTo summarize, excessive ROS activates primarily adipogenic differentiation and suppresses osteogenic differentiation. In our experiments, the compound F1 caused oxidative stress, F2 caused an antioxidative state followed by short-term oxidative stress, and F3 did not cause changes in intracellular ROS. In all cases, neither adipogenic nor osteogenic differentiation was obtained. We hypothesized that the detected activation of genes of myogenic differentiation was not a consequence of ROS disbalance.\\nThe tight interactions between ROS and autophagy are manifested in two aspects: the induction of autophagy by oxidative stress and ROS reduction by autophagy. The superoxide anion radical is considered a critical cellular signaling molecule regulating autophagy [86] . Autophagy, in turn, serves to reduce oxidative damage and ROS levels through the removal of protein aggregates and damaged organelles such as mitochondria [87] . Depletion of autophagy in MSCs exacerbates oxidative-stress-induced MSC death [88] . The internal regulatory mechanisms of autophagy by ROS can be summarized as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, which includes various molecular signal pathways such as ROS-FOXO3-LC3/BNIP3-autophagy, ROS-NRF2-P62-autophagy, ROS-HIF1-BNIP3/NIX-autophagy, and ROS-TIGAR-autophagy. Autophagy also may regulate ROS levels through several pathways such as the chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway, mitophagy pathway, and P62 delivery pathway [89] . Autophagy flux is considered a self-defensive process during the early stage of MSC injury, and this protective effect is abolished after prolonged oxidative exposure (several hours) [90] . In contrast, destructive autophagy is induced when it fails to neutralize excessive ROS [91] .\\nIn our experiments, short-term (within one hour) intracellular oxidative stress induced by compound F2 might induce self-defensive autophagy. Compound F3 did not affect ROS homeostasis. However, compound F1 caused prolonged oxidative stress, but did not induce autophagy. In general, we can assume that F2 caused autophagy due to fast short-term oxidative stress, and the subsequent antioxidant state was a consequence of autophagy.\\nA possible reason for the induction of autophagy by compound F2 may also be its alkalic character. Phosphonic acid is a medium-strength acid in the first stage and a weak acid in the second stage (K 1 = 5.1·10 −2 , K 2 = 1.8·10 −7 ). A 200 µM solution of F2 contains 1 mM of phosphonate groups, which creates a pH of about 9 and may cause intracellular alkalosis. It is known that intracellular pH value influences MSC proliferation, differentiation, and paracrine activity [92] . Indeed, the activation of the autophagic pathway can be caused by alkaline stress [93] .\\nTo sum, we hypothesized that F2 induces autophagy due to intracellular alkalosis and/or short-term oxidative stress, followed by an antioxidative state.\\nThe compound F2 contains potassium, and in the case of high concentration, 2 mM potassium enters the extracellular environment, and is comparable to its initial content. Recent studies confirm the significant role of potassium in the life of pluripotent stem cells [94] . Calcium-activated potassium channels have significant involvement in MSC differentiation, and could potentially enable novel tissue engineering approaches and therapies [95] . Calcium-dependent potassium channels control the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells and bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells [96] . Adipose-derived stem cells can differentiate into pacemaker-like cells via overexpression of the SK4 calciumdependent potassium channels gene [97] . Taking this into account, we cannot exclude the effect of potassium on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.\\nRecent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is necessary for differentiation processes in mesenchymal stem cells [92] , especially towards the osteoblastic lineage [98] . Autophagy seems to be important in the control of osteogenic differentiation, and this seems to be related to the early mTOR inhibition and the late activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling axis [99] . However, conflicting results have been reported on whether rapamycin decreases or increases osteogenesis, according to the cell type [100, 101] , once again suggesting that no general statement can be made on the role of autophagy. Interestingly, autophagy induced the skeletal myogenic differentiation of human-tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells [33] .\\nThus, we hypothesize that F2-induced autophagy may result in the activation of genes of myogenic differentiation of MSCs.\\nFullerenes have attractive outlooks in biology and medicine due to their unique mechanical, electrical, thermal, chemical, and optical properties [102] . Functionalization diminishes the toxicity of fullerenes and makes them water-soluble. Pristine fullerenes and their derivatives are considered as \"drugs\" (i.e., as inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus protease and transcriptase), antiviral pharmaceuticals, radical scavengers, drug and gene carriers, photosensitizers, and contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging [103] [104] [105] . In addition, fullerenes provide bacterial and viral inhibition, anticancer effects, and immunomodulation [106] .\\nCarbon nanomaterials modulate the biological behavior of MSCs by regulating the expression of MAPK. Park et al. [107] found that 2D graphene regulates the cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSCs by enhancing the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and cellular FAK-Src-ERK/JNK signaling molecules, while 1D carbon nanotubes induced MSC differentiation towards cardiac progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo [108, 109] . Yang et al. [110] found that the 0D fullerenol enhances the osteogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells due to their great antioxidative capacity. The authors investigated the effects of C 60 fullerene on the biological behavior of brown-adipose-derived stem cells, including survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and cardiomyogenic differentiation. C 60 fullerene improved the MAPK expression level and stem cell survival, proliferation, and cardiomyogenesis. In addition, C 60 fullerene improved the expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins (cTnT and alpha-sarcomeric actinin) and promoted gap junction formation among cells [36] . In our study, modification of C 60 resulted in the induction of myogenic differentiation in MSCs. Thus, fullerenes can be considered regulators of stem cells differentiation in all possible variants, and targeted modification of their structure can be a promising way to modify their properties.\\nLimitations. Here, we studied only the expression of genes and proteins. Even though F2 fullerene stimulated the differentiation towards the myogenic lineage up to the late stages, a complete understanding of its differentiation potential can be achieved after studying the functionality and characteristics of myocytes. This topic may be a goal for further research.\\nThe C 60 fullerene pentaphosphonic acid methyl ester (F1), C 60 fullerene pentaphosphonic acid potassium salt (F2), and C 60 fullerene pentaphosphonic acid 2-methoxyethyl ester (F3) were synthesized at the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences (Chernogolovka, Russia). All the compounds were highly soluble in water and the culture medium. Compounds F1-F3 were synthesized using the reaction of chlorofullerene C 60 Cl 6 and phosphites, as reported previously [39, 111] . Compounds F1-F2 were characterized previously [111] . Spectral data for compound F3 are given below.\\nCompound \\nFour MSC cultures from the Research Centre for Medical Genetics cell culture collection were isolated from normal adipose tissue of breasts of patients with adenocarcinoma sub-jected to a surgical operation. To obtain stromal cells, minced adipose tissue was digested with collagenase as described previously [112] . The tissue samples were mechanically disrupted in Dulbecco\\'s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Paneko, Moscow, Russia) containing 250 µg/mL gentamycin, 60 U/mL penicillin, and 60 U/mL streptomycin (Paneko, Moscow, Russia). The cells were dissociated by incubation with 0.04% collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories, Pashing, Austria) at 37 • C for 16 h. The cells were centrifuged at 200× g for 10 min, transferred into slide flasks, and cultivated at 37 • C in an AmnioMax C-100 Basal Medium (Gibco Products, Big Cabin, OK, USA) containing AmnioMax Supplement C-100, 20 mmol/L HEPES (Paneco, Moscow, Russia) and antibiotics. The cultures were split no more than four times before experiments. The fourth subculture was used for the experiments.\\nMSCs were characterized by standard markers using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The surface proteins expression was studied by flow cytofluorimetry with the appropriate antibodies with the CyFlow device (Sysmex Partec, Görlitz, Germany). The obtained CD-markers profile was typical for MSCs: CD34-, CD45-, HLA-ABC+, HLA-DR-, CD44+, CD29+, CD49b low, CD54 low, CD90+, CD106-, CD105+, CD117- [113] . In addition, cells differentiated into adipocytes in the presence of inducers in a kit for adipogenic differentiation (MesenCult Adipogenic Differentiation Kit, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada).\\nWe examined the effect of water-soluble C 60 fullerene derivatives F1, F2, and F3 in two concentrations on the expression of both genes and proteins. F1 was taken at concentrations of 398 nM and 170 µM; F2 was taken at concentrations of 456 nM and 195 µM; and F3 was taken at concentrations of 679 nM and 290 µM. The nanomolar concentrations were 427 times lower than the maximum nontoxic concentrations of the studied substances. MSCs were cultured with the fullerenes for 14 days. The culture medium was replaced by new portions every 4 days. The expression of differentiation markers was assessed at 7 and 14 days after the cultivation.\\nIn addition, the cells were subjected to differentiation in the presence of inducers in a kit for myogenic differentiation (MyoCult Differentiation Kit, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada).\\nEthical approval for the use of the MSCs was obtained from the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (September 2016, approval #5).\\nCells were grown in a 96-well plate for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as described previously [40, 41] . The plates were analyzed at 550 nm with EnSpire Plate Reader (EnSpire Equipment, Turku, Finland).\\nFluorescence microscopy was performed using an AxioScope A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) fluorescence microscope. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at +4 • C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by washing and blocking with 1% albumin solution in PBS and incubated overnight with primary antibodies to beclin1 (sc48341), OPN (Sc-20788), osteocalcin (s390877) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), LC3 (NB100-2220), Myf5 (NBP1-19565), MYF6 (NBP1-55582), MYOD1 (NBP1-54153), and Myogenine (NBP1-95760) (NovusBio, Centennial, CO, USA) at +4 • C (1 µg/mL in PBS in the presence of 1% albumin). Next, after washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies m-IgGκ BP-FITC: sc-516140 (mouse IgGκ light chain binding protein) and mouse anti-rabbit IgG-FITC: sc-2359 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) at room temperature, washed in PBS and, if necessary, stained with DAPI.\\nRNA was extracted from the cells using YellowSolve kits (Klonogen, St.-Petersburg, Russia) or Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the specified method (http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf, accessed on 22 March 2021). Next, phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (49:1) were performed. The RNA concentration was determined using a Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA reagent dye (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) on a tablet reader (EnSpire Equipment, Turku, Finland), λ em = 487 nm, λ fl = 524 nm. According to the standard protocol, the reverse transcription reaction was performed using reagents from Sileks (Moscow, Russia).\\nPCR was performed using the specific primers (Syntol, Moscow, Russia) and Sybr-Green intercalating dye on a StepOnePlus device (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primers used in the study are listed below as (F;R):\\nTBP The gene expressions were analyzed in several independent experiments in cells from different donors, and the results were processed using a calibration plot. The error was 2%.\\nAccording to the standard protocol, the protein expression was studied using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Treated and blank cells were removed from the medium, washed with 1% albumin in PBS solution, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 • C, washed, and permeabilized in 90% methanol at -20 • C. Next, the cell suspension was incubated with primary antibodies (1 µg/mL) to beclin1 (sc48341), OPN (Sc-20788), osteocalcin (s390877), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), LC3 (NB100-2220), Myf5 (NBP1-19565), MYF6 (NBP1-55582), MYOD1 (NBP1-54153), and Myogenine (NBP1-95760) (NovusBio, Centennial, CO, USA) overnight at +4 • C (1 µg/mL in PBS in the presence of 1% albumin), and, if necessary, with secondary antibodies (mouse anti-rabbit IgG-FITC: sc-2359; anti-mouse: sc-516140 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, and analyzed with a Cyflow cytofluorometer (Sysmex Partec, Görlitz, Germany).\\nExperiments were repeated in triplicate. In the FCA, the medians of the signal intensities were analyzed. Figures show the mean and standard deviation (SD). The significance of the observed differences was analyzed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test. The p-values < 0.005 were considered statistically significant, and are marked on figures with the \" * \" sign. The data were analyzed with Excel, Microsoft Office (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA); Statistica 6.0 (Dell Round Rock, TX, USA); and StatGraphics (Statgraphics Technologies, The Plains, VA, USA).\\nWe have shown that during prolonged culture of MSCs (7-14 days) in the presence of F2 fullerene, the cells were differentiated towards myogenic lineage. The expression of genes of transcription factors (MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5, and MRF4) that determine myogenic differentiation increased. The expression of genes of factors determining osteogenic differentiation (BMP2, BMP4, RUNX2, SPP1, and OCN) and adipogenic differentiation (CEBPB, LPL, and AP2 (FABP4)) was reduced or did not change. One of the reasons for the myogenic differentiation effect of F2 may be the stimulation of autophagy in cells due to intracellular alkalosis and/or short-term intracellular oxidative stress. This finding opens new prospects for the use of newly synthesized fullerene derivatives. \\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\\nAppendix A Figure A1 .

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the MERS crisis was a \\'wakeup call. \\' Like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and swine flu in 2009, epidemic outbreaks will continue to happen anywhere. Korea was simply unlucky. In retrospect, it is regrettable to say that we could have done much better. Scholars and colleagues in the medical informatics field should take a moment and think hard about how we can work to fight against another epidemic invasion in the future.\\nThe Ebola epidemic of 2013 is the largest such outbreak on record, influencing many nations in Africa as well as other countries [1] . The WHO expert panel has pointed out the inadequate emergency care response and has recommended more effective mechanisms for research and development. Others have strongly recommended WHO to innovate because recent Ebola outbreaks have been radically different from previous events, and they have tended to be simultaneous and parallel: \"Highly mobile populations, the spread of Ebola into densely populated cities ... made this epidemic of many outbreaks difficult to control [2] . \"\\nOther criticisms also include outdated therapeutic protocols, irrelevant information, untimely communication, delays in decision-making due to uncoordinated leadership, unreasonable social behavior, and so on. The recom- tems. The NEDSS can be called a medical informatics leader, which provides a standardized information infrastructure with HL7, LOINC, and SNOMED-CT. Highly useful information is well organized and ready to be used in the US-CDC [6] , so we don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel. All we need is to find a conduit for connection. For example, the task of disease surveillance for MERS is relatively small compared to NEDSS. Using the cell phone data network, we can instantly establish a real-time patient tracking system to monitor 3-tuple data (time, location, temperature) in the country. Cell phone rental can help track down suspicious foreign visitors from arrival to departure. With the support of ISO standards, global healthcare networking is not a hard nut to crack.\\nWhen the MERS epidemic outbreak was on the headline news, many attempts were made to compare MERS with tuberculosis. That is, the mortality rate of MERS is far below that of tuberculosis, so it was argued that there was no need to worry about it. The point was clear, but the timing was not right. Have you ever got a thorn stuck under your fingernail? Saying that \"It\\'s OK you\\'re not bleeding\" or \"You won\\'t die from it\" would not comfort anybody at all. I would venture to say that it is surely mistaken to compare the pain at present with a probable outcome yet to happen.\\nWhen hospital visitors became MERS patients, a typical example of nosocomial infection was demonstrated. It was a surprise attack, and the whole country was shaken and panicked. The WHO experts reminded us that hospital shopping greatly contributed to the rapid spread of MERS in Korea. We have to understand why patients pursue hospital shopping. The death of professionalism may be an unexpected result of the fashionable social network services (SNS). Patients use SNSs to data-mine their own diagnosis and prescription and then seek medical advice to compare with their own ideas about their personal health. However, such patients suggesting their own diagnoses and treatments can be described as \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". Medical informatics leadership was nowhere to be found. When the MERS epidemic turned fatal, SNS was the only rescue. MERS was unknown to the general public, and the cure was uncertain, so chaos was bound to happen.\\nIn Korea medical informatics is on trial. We are standing in front of a river that runs medicine. IT has been trying to cross the river but has never been successful, especially in medical expert systems. The other side of the river is not the land of promise. Because the river of medicine eventu-ally runs into the ocean of the human race, why don\\'t we go with the river instead? There is no doubt that doctors and nurses were the final frontiers in the MERS battle. Despite all the wonderful scientific accomplishments, the MERS crisis reminds us that clinical expertise is the most important value as clearly as ever. Technology can help medicine, not the other way around; that is the way medical informatics should go in between.\\nTaoism states that dynamic balance can be obtained from two opposite powers competing with each other, unifying as a complete energy. Similarly, medical informatics should be able to balance between analog medicine and digital technology to create a new value. Medicine is composed of oldfashioned values, such as rapport, which is fading out slowly. Digital technology should help clinicians restore the humanistic flavor of medicine by eliminating managerial overload in healthcare settings. Technology can start from there. Neither Cyclops (the single-eyed monster in Homer\\'s Odyssey) nor Argus (the 100-eyed giant in Greek mythology) is ideal to find the right path. Two-eyed medical informaticians must walk through the path on the mountain ridge, carefully looking at both sides of IT and medicine for balance.\\nIn 1347, the first biological warfare took place in the siege of Caffa (now Feodosia in Ukraine) on the Black Sea coast. The Mongol army with bubonic plague catapulted corpse of those who had died from the Black Death over the city walls. Fleeing from central trading ports along the coast, infected inhabitants and rats may have carried the disease throughout Europe [7] (The plague might have killed more than 25 million people). A few regions survived. They simply closed their ports of entry and isolated patients in remote places. The same principle still applies. When in doubt, isolate an infection until it\\'s clear. Time goes by, technology advances, but the basic principle never changes. Medicine should stay analog with a little hint of digital. That\\'s all it takes to fight against any epidemic or pandemic attack in the future.', 'a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111\\nSince the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 [1] , the global public has been inundated with information related to the rapidly evolving Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [2] . Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] , worldwide public health networks [4] , and government public health agencies [5] have used multiple media platforms (e.g., internet, television, radio, print) in attempts to keep the public informed of emerging details and public health recommendations. In Canada, this messaging has included mitigation strategies such as appropriate hand and face hygiene practices [5] , physical distancing policies including closing non-essential business and public spaces [5] , restrictions and limitations on visitation in hospitals and long-term care facilities [6] , and travel restrictions [5] . Effective and transparent communication of evolving information related to COVID-19 is needed to ensure the public understands how and why to adapt their behaviors to bolster public safety [7] . However, the influx of COVID-19 information and widespread circulation and exchange of misinformation (i.e., false or inaccurate information) [8, 9] have been linked to increased public fear [10] , under-use of health services [11] , and distrust in government messaging [12] -a phenomenon the WHO has characterized as an \\'infodemic\\' (a term originally coined in 2003 by David Rothkopf in the Washington Post during SARS), to describe when the proliferation of information about a problem detracts from possible solutions) [9] .\\nEffective pandemic management is dependent on understanding public views and behaviors, including concerns, frequently used and trusted sources of information, and reasons to observe or violate public health mandates [7, 13] . Countries around the world have used online crosssectional surveys to rapidly assess public awareness, understand health behaviors, and identify sources of information and misinformation during COVID-19 [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . A survey of the American and British public very early in the pandemic indicated adequate public awareness of disease transmission but a lack of understanding of appropriate preventative measures as well as high uptake of common misconceptions which were circulating on social media [18] . Evidence collected from public surveys [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] may inform the development of targeted public health messaging and track uptake of new information [20] ; however, to date no comprehensive Canadian-based surveys investigating public perspectives related to COVID-19 and potential variations by geographic region have been published. This may be particularly important given the variation across provinces and territories in COVID-19 case burden and local government response [21] . We conducted a national survey of adults residing in Canada to gain a better understanding of public perceptions in several important domains-beliefs (e.g. severity of pandemic, concerns, impact on health), knowledge acquisition (e.g. sources, topics), and behaviors (e.g. isolation and physical distancing)-related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This benchmarking data will help inform future public health messaging and initiatives.\\nWe developed a cross-sectional, online, anonymous survey and contracted Ipsos Incorporated (https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca), a world-wide market research and polling firm, to administer it across Canada. We first iteratively synthesized a comprehensive list of questions based on broad content areas reported in previously published survey research on pandemics [22] [23] [24] [25] and in current COVID-19 public opinion polls [15] . We subsequently invited seven members of the research team (co-investigators, research assistants, and patient partners) to provide feedback on question format, comprehensiveness, clarity, and flow [26] . We refined the questionnaire based on feedback.\\nThe questionnaire domains and sub-domains are illustrated in S1 Fig. Question types included 5-point unipolar scales (e.g., 1 = not at all/poor, 5 = extremely/excellent), 7-point bipolar agreement scales (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree), single-response multiple choice, and multiple response multiple choice. We randomized the order of the response options to reduce response selection bias [26] . We compared respondents\\' retrospective ratings of five domains of overall health (mental/emotional, physical, social, economic, spiritual) at the start of 2020 to ratings of their health status at the time of data collection, with differences categorized into \\'worse\\', \\'same\\', or \\'better\\'. We provided respondents with definitions for self-isolation and social/physical distancing. Self-isolation was defined as \"separating yourself from others, including those within your home, with the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus (whether diagnosed or undiagnosed, with or without symptoms\" and social/physical distancing defined as \"limiting your time in spaces occupied by others, including reducing trips to visit others in person and reducing time spent in public spaces.\"\\nTo ascertain whether the questionnaire could be completed within 15-minutes, we piloted it with a sample of 104 Canadian residents. No changes to the questionnaire were made and we therefore included the pilot responses in the final data set. The questionnaire was optimized for \\'device agnosticism\\' to ensure its compatibility across most systems (e.g., mobile phone, computer, tablet). The final questionnaire (see S1 Appendix) was formatted in English and French and consisted of 21 demographic and 46 COVID-19-related questions covering three overarching domains of self-reported perceptions: beliefs, knowledge acquisition, and behaviors. Dalhousie University (#2020-5121) and University of Calgary (#20-0538) Research Ethics Boards approved this study. Prior to entering the questionnaire, respondents reviewed an informed consent page; consent was implied by completing the questionnaire.\\nThe questionnaire was distributed electronically through Ipsos\\' proprietary iSay panel of approximately 250,000 Canadians using direct email and social media posts. Panelists were eligible to complete the survey if they were adults (�18 years), lived in Canada, and were able to read English or French. We screened respondents by age (18-34, 35-55, >55) , sex at birth (female/male), and provincially defined regions (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan/ Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, and Atlantic provinces) to ensure population representation based on 2016 census data [27] . Respondents received Ipsos reward points after completing the questionnaire; points are accumulated and redeemed for gift cards and merchandise.\\nWe derived a minimum sample size estimate of 385 based on a normal approximation to the binomial distribution with a finite population correction applied [28] (assuming an observed proportion of respondents selecting a specific response option of 50%) that incorporated population size (~36.3 million in Canada), a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 5%. We elected to collect 2,000 questionnaires to allow for regional subgroup analyses and calculated the associated margin of error to be +/-2.2% at a 95% confidence level.\\nWe used descriptive statistics (frequencies (percent) or means (standard deviation)) to summarize respondent characteristics. We weighted responses by age, sex, and regional population estimates derived from 2016 census data [27] . Likert scales were reported as frequencies with percent for each point on the scale. We tested for overall differences between regions using weighted chisquared tests. If p was less than 0.05, we followed with post-hoc comparisons using weighted logistic region to quantify differences between regions with odds ratios (OR) using Ontario as the comparison group. We conducted all quantitative data analyses using SPSS, version 23 and R, version 3.5.1 [29] . We used the R package \"survey\" version 3.36 [30] to obtain weighted descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, and OR estimates. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05.\\nWe collected data from April 26 th to May 1 st , 2020. We excluded four respondents who reported being unaware of the current COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a final sample of 1,996 respondents. On the last date data was collected (May 1 st ) there were 56,158 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada; 83% of the cases were in the two most populated provinces, Québec (51%) and Ontario (32%).\\nOf the 1,996 respondents, 135 respondents (6.8%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5.7%-7.9%) reported that they currently or previously had an illness that they believed was COVID-19. Only 12 (0.6%, 95%CI 0.3%-0.9%) of these reported ever testing positive for COVID-19, 41 (2.1%, 95% CI 1.4%-2.7%) tested negative, and 82 (4.1%, 95% CI 3.2%-5.0%) were not tested. Most (n = 1,858, 93.2%, 95%CI 92.1%-94.3%) were either uncertain (n = 96, 4.8%, 95% CI 3.9%-5.8%) or believed they had not contracted COVID-19 (n = 1762, 88.4%, 95%. CI 87.0%-89.8%); one-fifth of all respondents (n = 404, 20.3%, 95% CI 18.5%-22.0%) reported personally knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19. Our survey sample is proportionally similar to the Canadian population [27] in terms of sex (female, 54vs51), age distribution (18-29 years, 15vs19; 30-44 years, 25vs24; 45-64 years, 32vs35), marital status (single, 25vs24; married/living together, 58vs58; separated/divorced/widowed, 14vs14), college or university educated (56vs54), and housing (detached dwelling, 55vs54). The percentage of respondents 65 years and older was somewhat higher in our sample (28%) than reported in the national census (21%). Just over one-half (n = 563, 50.1%) of the 1001 employed respondents in our survey were working in a job deemed essential and 14 percent (n = 143) of unemployed respondents (n = 995) reported their unemployment being a direct result of COVID-19. Respondent characteristics are summarized in Table 1 as unweighted results. \\nA majority (n = 1,236, 62.1%, 95%CI 59.9%-64.2%) of respondents perceived COVID-19 to be a very serious problem in Canada though only a small proportion (n = 268, 13.5%, 95% CI 11.9%-15.0%) rated it to be slightly more or much serious than in other countries ( Table A in S2 Appendix). More respondents were moderately or extremely concerned about a family member contracting COVID-19 (n = 889, 45.3%, 95%CI 43.0%-47.5%) than were concerned about themselves contracting the disease (568/1,885 reported not believing they had contracted COVID-19, 30.1%, 95%CI 28.1%-32.2%) (Fig 1) . In rating concerns about the impacts of COVID-19 on the health system , a greater proportion of respondents were moderately or extremely concerned that there would be insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital staff to stay safe (n = 1,024, 51.7%, 95%CI 49.5%-53.9%) compared to concerns about access to healthcare and availability of equipment to care for COVID-19 patients (Fig 1) .\\nJust under half (n = 898, 45.2%, 95%CI 43.0%-47.4%) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the pandemic was stressful; however, fewer (n = 566, 28.5%, 95%CI 26.5%-30.5%) agreed or strongly agreed that it was something that made them feel helpless (Fig A in S2 Appendix). When asked to sequentially rate their past (start of 2020) and present health (physical, mental/emotional, social, economic, spiritual), respondents expressed experiencing declines in all dimensions of health with the largest decreases reported for social health (n = 964, 48.5%, 95%CI 46.3%-50.7%) and mental/emotional health (n = 778, 39.1%, 95%CI 36.9%-41.2%) (Fig 2) .\\nThe majority of respondents (n = 1,741, 87.5%, 95%CI 86.1%-89.0%) rated their understanding of how the virus was spread as good (n = 629, 31.6%, 95%CI 29.5%-33.7%), very good (n = 793, 39.9%, 95%CI 37.7%-42.0%), or excellent (n = 319, 16.1%, 95%CI 14.4%-17.7%). Fig  3 shows respondents\\' level of agreement to a series of statements about the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. The highest consensus among respondents was in agreeing or strongly agreeing that people can be infected with COVID-19 and not show any symptoms (n = 1,713, 86.5%, 95%CI 84.9%-88.0%). There was greater variability across respondents in their degree of agreement to other knowledge-based statements (Fig 3) .\\nWhen respondents were asked how often they search for information about COVID-19, over half (n = 1,345, 67.9%, 95%CI 65.8%-69.9%) reported searching once per day or more \\nand predominantly accessing and trusting Canadian over American or other international sources for their information. The top accessed source was Canadian news-based television, print, or websites (n = 1,488, 75.6%, 95% CI 73.6%-77.5%) (Fig 4) . The lowest rated sources for COVID-19 information included social media posts from influencers or celebrities (n = 1,039, 54.8% selected as least trusted, 95% CI 52.5%-57.1%) and American news television, print, and websites (n = 711, 50.4% selected as source of misinformation, 95% CI 47.7%-53.0%). Consistent with valuing Canadian sources, respondents most frequently reported going directly to government or health authority sources (n = 979, 50.6%, 95% CI 48.4%-52.8%) to verify information (Fig B in S2 Appendix) .\\nHalf of respondents surveyed (n = 1,017, 51.3%, 95% CI 49.1%-53.5%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were able to find the kind of information they want about COVID-19 ( Fig C  in S2 Appendix) . Information about COVID-19 infection rates dominated respondent\\'s searches (n = 1,414, 71.5%, 95% CI 69.5%-73.5%) (Fig D in S2 Appendix) , while information about vaccines and treatments were most frequently (n = 933, 48.9%, 95% CI 46.7%-51.2%) cited as topics of misinformation (Fig D in S2 Appendix) from those who reported having seen or heard incorrect or misleading information related to COVID-19 during the previous two weeks (n = 1,520, 75.3%, 95% CI 73.4%-77.3%). Yet, only half (n = 937, 47.4%, 95% CI 45.2%-49.6%) of respondents felt moderately or extremely confident that they could identify incorrect or misleading information about COVID-19 (Fig E in S2 Appendix) , and comparable numbers reported being uncertain (n = 455, 23.0%, 95% CI 21.2%-24.9%) or agreeing (n = 634, 32.1%, 95% CI 30.0%-34.2%) that they find it hard to determine if an information source was trustworthy or not (Fig C in S2 Appendix) .\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241259.g001\\nJust under half of respondents indicated they were in self-isolation (n = 842, 43.4%, 95% CI 41.2%-45.6%). Of those who were not self-isolating (n = 1,144), the vast majority (n = 1,083, 95.1%, 95% CI 93.8%-96.4%) reported that they practiced physical distancing always (n = 783, 68.8%, (95% CI 66.0%-71.5%) or often (n = 300, 26.3%, 95% CI 23.7%-28.9%). Furthermore, many (n = 814, 41.0%, 95% CI 38.9%-43.2%) respondents felt that they could reasonably sustain their current level of physical distancing longer than six months (or as long as needed) (Fig 5) . Self-reported distancing behaviors were consistent with respondent perceptions of \\'self\\' as effective agents to prevent the spread of the virus, with most (n = 1,380, 69.7%, 95% CI 67.7%-71.8%) agreeing or strongly agreeing that they were doing a good job at preventing the spread of the virus with changes to their behavior; about one-third (n = 677, 34.9%, 95% CI 32.7%-37.0%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were doing a better job than other people (Fig C in S2 Appendix) . Respondents (mean age of 50) most commonly perceived teenagers as least consistently practicing physical distancing (n = 855, 43.2%, 95% CI 41.0%-45.4%) while identifying middle-aged adults (n = 786, 39.6%, 95%CI 37.4%-41.8%) and seniors (n = 744, 37.5%, 95%CI 35.4%-39.6%) as most consistently practicing physical distancing (Fig F in S2  Appendix) .\\nThe most frequently selected reasons (Fig 6) for self-isolating or physical distancing were to protect oneself (n = 1,602, 81.0%, 95% CI 79.2%-82.7%), to protect other people in one\\'s household (n = 970, 49.1%, 95% CI 46.8%-51.3%) and to protect other members of the general public (n = 962, 48.6%, 95% CI 46.4%-50.8%). Three-quarters (n = 1,436, 75.8%, 95% CI 73.9%-77.8%) of respondents reported that they would get vaccinated for the virus when a vaccine became available. \\nRegional differences. Overall analyses based on the Chi-squared tests revealed several associations between the region in which respondents resided and their self-reported perceptions (see Table A in S3 Appendix). Post-hoc multiple comparisons presented as Odds Ratios are in Table B in S3 Appendix. In comparison to respondents in Ontario, respondents in all other regions were less likely to believe that COVID-19 was a very serious problem in Canada (0.50 to 0.74 times as likely to report COVID-19 was a very serious problem) and were more likely to be \"not at all\" concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on hospitals (e.g. 1.86 to 2.50 times as likely to report being \"not at all\" concerned at lack of PPE) and patients (e.g. limited access to necessary services, 1.72 to 2.84 times as likely to report being \"not at all\" concerned). A complete lack of concern about themselves or a family member contracting the virus also was more likely to be expressed by respondents in regions outside of Ontario, compared to those in Ontario. This included respondents in Québec in spite of being more likely to have close friends who tested positive for COVID-19 (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.39-4.11) and having the highest rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time. Respondents in British Columbia, Québec, and Manitoba/Saskatchewan were less stressed by the pandemic than were respondents in Ontario, although Québec respondents also were more likely to strongly agree that the pandemic made them feel helpless (OR 2.38, 95%CI 1.71-3.32). There were no statistically significant associations between region and self-reported ratings of physical, mental/emotional, social, or economic health. Respondents in Québec felt least knowledgeable about how the virus is spread, reporting \"fair\" more often than respondents in Ontario (OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.08-2.18), while respondents in Manitoba/Saskatchewan were more likely to report \"very good\" understanding than did respondents in Ontario (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13-2.40) but less \\nlikely to report \"excellent\" (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.73). Respondents in Alberta and the Atlantic provinces were less likely to access Canadian news than respondents from Ontario, and along with respondents from Québec, were less likely to access American news. Respondents from all regions but British Columbia were less likely to access international sources than respondents from Ontario. Respondents in Québec were less likely to agree (15%) or strongly agree (36.9%) that they would get vaccinated compared to those in Ontario (OR 0.71, 95% 0.52-0.98 and OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87, respectively) while respondents from Alberta were more likely to strongly disagree (9.1%) that they will get vaccinated (OR 1.91, 95% 1.08-3.40). With changes to their behavior, respondents in Quebec are more likely to strongly agree that they are doing a good job at preventing the spread of COVID-19 compared to respondents from Quebec (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.69).\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has substantially altered many aspects of public life, yet little is known about the perspectives and experiences of broader populations. Our study provides a national cross-sectional description of public perceptions, knowledge and behaviors related to COVID-19 in the context of the evolving pandemic, adding to survey data published early in the outbreak [16] [17] [18] . Our data suggest that Canadians are concerned about the threat of COVID-19 to the healthcare system, to themselves and their family members, and that they consider the ongoing pandemic a serious problem on both national and international levels. There are three main findings of the survey: (1) the negative impact of the pandemic on Canadians\\' perceptions of their health, (2) the frequent searching for up-to-date information about COVID-19 (largely via Canadian based sources), and (3) current and future perceived desire and ability of the public to comply with public health recommendations (e.g. physical distancing, vaccination for COVID-19 if/when available). To our knowledge, this is the first national survey in Canada to comprehensively assess multiple domains of public perceptions important to understanding the public\\'s response to the ongoing pandemic.\\nWe found that overall health has been markedly impacted by pandemic conditions, and that this is largely irrespective of personal infection with COVID-19. In fact, very few of our respondents reported ever testing positive for COVID-19, yet many perceived that aspects of their overall health had deteriorated, particularly mental/emotional and social health. This is further evidenced in high agreement among our respondents that the pandemic is stressful, which may be unassociated with case burden. Although respondents in Ontario, a province with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, were more likely to report stress than those in other provinces, respondents in Québec, also a province with high cases, did not. The need to assess and respond to health impacts beyond infection with SARS-Cov-2 has been increasingly recognized as a critical part of pandemic response [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . For example, dramatic shifts in routines, livelihoods and behaviors during quarantine, coupled with the unfulfilled basic need for human connection [33] , have been described as significant threats to mental health and well-being. In addition, findings from surveys commissioned by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) and the charity MQ: Transforming Mental Health through Research reported widespread public concern about isolation, loneliness, practical aspects of \\nlife (e.g. finances), and general negative feelings, and provided groundwork for the collaborative development of sweeping research priorities to improve these conditions [34] . In our survey, fewer respondents reported that the pandemic makes them feel helpless, suggesting some resiliency to the detrimental circumstances the pandemic has produced.\\nThe media\\'s role in disseminating information that will concurrently educate and motivate public behaviors in accordance with recommended guidance and avoid creating undue stress, skepticism, or rebuff of guidelines is a critical factor in navigating pandemic response [32, 34, 38] . Our study found that the public frequently searches for information about COVID-19 and is primarily getting information from domestic news sources, including television, print, and websites that are not government or public health agency websites. Respondents in our study also view news sources as equally credible to national government and public health websites. This finding suggests that public health officials should view mainstream media, and in particular television, as important promoters or messengers of COVID-19-related information. Given this, it is crucial for mainstream media to take this responsibility seriously to ensure accurate information is conveyed. At the same time, perceptions of trust may be moderated by other factors not accounted for in this survey, such as perceived congruence between government guidelines and impact reducing virus spread. In our survey, respondents from Ontario and Québec reported the least amount of trust in Canadian government and news sources and these were also the same provinces with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada (32% and 51%, respectively).\\nMuch attention has been paid to the proliferation of information about COVID-19, raising concerns about parallel increases in misinformation. We found that a substantial proportion of respondents value science-based sources (e.g. government websites) which may explain \\nhigh rates of self-reported behavior change to prevent virus spread. This correlates with other public opinion data [39] ; however, about half of our respondents still expressed only moderate levels of confidence in being able to identify misleading information (Fig E in S2 Appendix) or determine if an information source is trustworthy (Fig C in S2 Appendix) . Of note, many respondents indicated that they do not view American news sources as trustworthy, and more specifically, see it as a source of misinformation. Familiarity with and interest in context-specific information may influence respondents\\' perceptions of credibility. Social media posts were also commonly identified as untrustworthy, however, these perceptions ranged depending on who was sharing the information. Posts from family and friends or influencers were viewed as less trustworthy than posts from government or public health agencies. As a quickresponse platform with open posting and limited moderation, misinformation is easily spread on social media [39] [40] [41] . While some social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) have increased efforts to monitor and remove incorrect or harmful information related to COVID-19 in an attempt to reduce public consumption of misinformation, the effectiveness of these efforts is currently unknown [42] . We found that our respondents most frequently fact checked their information using government and public health websites (51%) and scientific articles (30%), but greater efforts to better understand how individuals may proactively limit their exposure to misinformation, identify misinformation, and fact check information are needed.\\nThe vast majority of respondents in our study reported practicing a high level of physical distancing, and a surprisingly high number felt that they could maintain this for a long period of time (6 months or more) if necessary. This finding is somewhat unexpected given the high level of reported self-isolation amongst our respondents. Although it may be that not all respondents clearly understood the difference between self-isolation and physical distancing, it is evident that most were motivated to limit social and physical interactions as a means to protect themselves and others from becoming infected with COVID-19. The lower than predicted infection rates in many countries has been credited largely to the high public compliance of mandated preventative measures. However, this comes at a price, including significant global economic losses [43] . In our survey, 14% of respondents reported unemployment as a result of the pandemic, and 34% of all respondents reported worse economic health.\\nIn contrast to respondents\\' positive association to physical distancing recommendations, we report slightly lower numbers of respondents who intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once available as compared to other recent surveys [44] . While this is another somewhat unanticipated finding given the reported propensity of respondents to access and trust sources considered \\'reputable\\' (e.g., public health agencies), individual and social determinants of vaccination are wide-ranging [45] [46] [47] [48] . Previous research has highlighted that the media can both hinder [49, 50] and enhance [50] vaccination uptake. To optimize potential future vaccine uptake, public health agencies should align key messaging with public perceptions, concerns, and information needs (e.g. preferred sources) [51, 52] , tailoring by jurisdiction. For example, in our study, respondents from the province with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (Québec) were significantly less likely to report that they plan to get vaccinated (Table B in S3 Appendix) and reported the least amount of trust in Canadian government and news sources. Such complexities must be taken seriously if we are to ensure that public health recommendations are effectively communicated.\\nOur survey has limitations. Although providing a broad snapshot of population, cross-sectional surveys capture relevant data only at a single moment in time on specific topics. In a rapidly changing landscape, it is expected that self-reported perceptions and behaviors would change with new information. The use of serial surveys [13, 14, 44] is one strategy to strengthen cross-sectional survey designs. At the same time, our study provides useful descriptive data at a pandemic peak in Canada. Subsequent qualitative methodologies will further enrich our understanding of public actions and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, as we elected to set a survey response quota, we are not able to determine a response rate. While there is a risk of non-response bias, the rapid collection of responses to reach our 2,000 quota (five days) and methodological strengths in our design (rigorous development including pre-testing and device agnosticism, large sample size, population representation and weighting by age, sex at birth, and region) outweigh this limitation. Third, differences in public perceptions that may be associated with socio-demographic factors such as age and gender were not addressed in this manuscript but will be the focus of future investigation. Finally, though overall results may be affected by larger numbers of respondents from Canada\\'s two largest provinces (Ontario and Québec), the weighting ensures results accurately reflect the actual regional populations within Canada. At the same time, regional differences should be cautiously interpreted as we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.\\nWe conducted a national survey including a representative sample of the Canadian public to assess overall perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results highlight the impact of the pandemic on individual perceptions of health which may be further exacerbated by salient concerns around risks of infection, healthcare safety, and access. We found that knowledge about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The findings of this study should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics. ', 'The world was made aware of a newly discovered coronavirus via an email from Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20- September-2014 (ProMED, 2014 . That first case was a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA and, thanks to the email, the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient from Qatar, was transferred to the United Kingdom for care ( Fig. 1) (Bermingham et al., 2012) . As of 20th January 2015, there have been 969 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies reported publicly, 955 confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (n = 351, 37%; data from public sources including the WHO and Ministries of Health). First known as novel coronavirus (nCoV), the following two to three years were a slow discovery process revealing a virus that appears well established among dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. From infected DCs, the virus is thought to infrequently infect exposed humans. Concern was raised early on that patenting of the first viral isolate would lead to restricted access to the virus and to viral diagnostics (Sciencemag, 2014) . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were available (Abdel-Moneim, 2014) almost immediately. Virus was also made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations, supporting many of the research findings described herein. In search of an animal host, bats were implicated in August 2013 but in that same month a DC link was reported (Reusken et al., 2013c) and that link has matured into a verifiable association. In humans, overt disease was finally given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome and the acronym MERS. From these animal-to-human spillover events, the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV; see Section 3 for variation in naming) spread sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older males with underlying diseases. The proportion of infected people who are confirmed to have died from MERS-CoV infection is much higher than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, influenza virus or many other pathogens. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, which in 2012-2014 usually commenced in March (Mackay, 2014; Maltezou and Tsiodras, 2014) . This spread may be linked to some seasonal environmental changes, change in host animal behaviour, or perhaps simple coincidence between season and successive hospital outbreaks. Approximately a fifth of all cases to date have involved healthcare workers (HCWs), spiking alongside periods of increased total case numbers. Social media, blogs and the mainstream media have kept close tabs on the spread of MERS-CoV to 23 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States of America (USA; Fig. 2 ), mostly with an origin in the KSA from where 88% of viral detections have occurred. Twitter in particular has provided a global forum through specific hashtags like #MERS and the Arabic hashtag #AF4FD? or #Coruna. An engaged world has helped understand how the virus has affected the KSA and its neighbouring countries and allowed outsiders to view science musings take shape, collaborations form, local news and commentary trend and new results be discussed in real time. Social media provides new avenues for scientists to express experienced opinion, to more widely communicate their research and to engage with public health entities, the public themselves and the mainstream media. This degree of engagement was not possible in 2002/2003 when the SARS global outbreak began its rise to 8100 human cases including 770 deaths (proportion of fatal cases, or PFC, of 9.5%). The ubiquity of social media appears to have changed what the public expects from a State when it communicates about new or existing infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, and how quickly they expect that to occur.\\nPatients with MERS often present themselves to a hospital with systemic and lower respiratory tract (LRT) signs and symptoms of disease which usually include fever, chills or rigors, dry or productive cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and one or more comorbidities including diabetes (prevalent in the KSA), chronic kidney disease including renal failure, chronic heart disease and heart failure, recent surgery, hypertension, chronic lung disease, asthma, obesity, smoking, malignant disease or steroid use (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV may be identified in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction which can precede death in over a third of infections (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . Extrapulmonary disease manifestations include circulatory, renal, hepatic and hematologic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in 20-33% of cases (Assiri et al., 2013a; Mailles et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) , manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen at all in one family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) nor among symptomatic children in another . On occasion, fever and gastrointestinal upset may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline to be are later followed by more severe systemic and respiratory signs and symptoms (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Mailles et al., 2013) . Rarely, MERS-CoV has been detected in a person with fever but no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms . The extent to which infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens affect this variability is unknown.\\nChest radiography of MERS patients, as distinct from MERS-CoV positive people with a subclinical infection, reveal infiltrates consistent with acute viral pneumonia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Devi et al., 2014; Tsiodras et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) . Only on rare occasions have studies described upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms. In one example, approximately 15-25% of cases presented with rhinorrhoea and/or sore throat Memish et al., 2013b; Payne et al., 2014; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . To date, MERS has been an opportunistic disease. Severe MERS has been defined by admission to an intensive care unit; use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical ventilation or vasopressors; cases being reported as critical or severe; a fatal outcome (Arabi et al., 2014) . The relative speed of disease progression may relate to MERS-CoV reaching earlier peak viral loads and infecting different cells than the SARS-CoV (Drosten, 2013) . Nonetheless, it is also apparent that MERS is not restricted to those with comorbidities. With increased laboratory testing, particularly of contacts of confirmed MERS cases, a number of MERS-CoV positive individuals without comorbidities have been detected who experience a mild illness or no symptoms at all (Al-Tawfiq and . This demonstrates that MERS, like most respiratory viruses, is associated with a wide spectrum of symptoms and degrees of severity.\\nThe mean incubation period in a study of 47 cases was 5.2 days, with 95% of cases having shown symptoms within 12.4 days (Assiri et al., 2013a) . In a smaller study the incubation period ranged between one and nine days, with 13-14 days between when illness began in one person and subsequently spread to another . The length and nature of the prodrome is undefined to date. The first WHO case definition (World Health Organization, 2014a) defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough, requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of LRT involvement and included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would meet the case definition and be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on (Assiri et al., 2013a) . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases (World Health Organization, 2014d) . Apart from reports from the WHO and KSA Ministry of Health, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection have also been documented in the scientific literature Memish et al., 2014b) . In one such case, a HCW shed virus for 42 days in the absence of disease (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014) .\\nMERS can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring external ventilation and then to multiorgan failure (Devi et al., 2014; Reuss et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) similar to severe influenza and SARS cases . Acute renal failure can occur in MERS patients, doing so sooner than it did among SARS patients (Eckerle et al., 2013) . Progressive impairment of renal function and acute kidney injury can start 9-12 days after symptom onset among MERS patients, compared to a median of 20 days for SARS patients (Chu et al., 2005; Eckerle et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . This may be due to direct infection of renal tissue by MERS-CoV (Arabi et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) . Haematologic changes in MERS cases include thrombocytopenia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Drosten et al., 2013; Omrani et al., 2013) and lymphocytosis (Assiri et al., 2013a) or lymphopenia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Omrani et al., 2013) on admission (Assiri et al., 2013a) . Monocyte numbers are often normal (Assiri et al., 2013a) while neutrophils may be raised or normal (Assiri et al., 2013a) .\\nAs a group, children have rarely been reported to be positive for the virus. Between 1st September 2012 and 2nd December 2013, 11 paediatric cases (2-16 years of age; median 13-years) were identified in total; nine were asymptomatic (72%) and one died . In Amman, Jordan, 1005 samples from hospitalised children under the age of 2-years with fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms were tested but none were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, despite being collected at a similar time to the first known outbreak of MERS-CoV in the neighbouring town of Al-Zarqa (Khuri-Bulos et al., 2013) . A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother subsequently developed antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case .\\nThe virus associated with MERS was initially identified as the \"novel coronavirus\" or nCOV; a problematic choice given that other novel coronaviruses could be discovered and were being discovered with regularity prior to and since the identification of MERS-CoV. When the first genome of a human variant was sequenced it was named human betacoronavirus 2c EMC (subsequently referred to here as EMC/2012), with the implication that it was a human not animal coronavirus. There were also variants named England-Qatar, Jordan-N3 and England 1. Ten months after its discovery, the coronavirus study group assembled an international consensus and the virus was renamed and given the acronym of MERS-CoV (de Groot et al., 2013) .\\nMERS-CoV is a putative member of a new species (van Boheemen et al., 2012) within the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, subgroup 2c (Raj et al., 2014b) . The first full sequence defined a singlestranded, positive sense, 30,119 nucleotide (nt) long genome ( Fig. 3) (van Boheemen et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) . Based on analysis of 42 complete sequences, the genome is predicted to be evolving at 1.12 × 10 −3 substitutions per site (Cotten et al., 2014) . This permitted a predictive calculation of the time to most recent viral ancestor (tMRCA) for most of the variants, which suggested MERS-CoV first appeared around March 2012 (ranging from December 2011 to July 2012) (Cotten et al., 2014) . Comparison of the first open reading frame\\'s (ORF 1ab) amino acid sequence to that from its closest betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, found there was less than 80% identity which supported the conclusion that MERS-CoV was a novel and distinct virus. This genomic region is a key taxonomic identifier of CoV species. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode at least ten open reading frames bracketed by /2012 variant isolated from sputum of a 60-year old man from Bisha, KSA) . Open reading frames are indicated as yellow rectangles bracketed by terminal untranslated regions (UTR; grey rectangles). The 5 UTR includes the predicted leader (L) transcription-regulatory sequence. FS-frame-shift. Predicted papain-like proteinase cleavage sites are indicated with orange arrows resulting in ∼16 cleavage non-structural protein products (based on (van Boheemen et al., 2012) ). The genome is drawn to scale using Geneious v6.1.6 and annotated using Adobe Illustrator. MERS-CoV EMC/2012 sequence GenBank accession number JX869059 5 and 3 untranslated regions (Raj et al., 2014b) . Structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (van Boheemen et al., 2012) . Nonstructural proteins (nsps) from the products of ORF1a and ORF1b have been predicted, following identification of conserved domains and after comparative analysis with other coronaviral proteins. The nsps include a papainlike protease (PLpro; nsp4 (Kilianski et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014) transmembrane domains (nsp4, nsp6), a 3C-like protease (3CLpro; nsp5 (Kilianski et al., 2013) ), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12), a helicase (nsp13) and an exonuclease (nsp14) (van Boheemen et al., 2012) .\\nComplete genome deduction using deep sequencing methods has been the predominant tool for genome analysis during the emergence of MERS-CoV (Cotten et al., 2013a (Cotten et al., ,b, 2014 the first time it\\'s use has been so pervasive for the study of a viral outbreak with global reach. While the error rate can be higher than for traditional Sanger sequencing, the near-complete genomic length covered by just a single run (e.g. 90% of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 genome) and the depth of coverage at each nucleotide is such that deep sequencing corrects for erroneous nucleotide van Boheemen et al., 2012) . Subgenomic sequencing, a mainstay of viral genotyping and molecular epidemiology to this point, has been used rarely for MERS-CoV identification or confirmation, despite assays having been suggested early on Corman et al. (2012b) . Such an approach is simpler, more accessible to a wider range of laboratories and faster. It\\'s utility has since been demonstrated using molecular assays to amplify and sequence a 615 nucleotide long fragment of the spike S2 domain gene fragment (Smits et al., 2015) . This assay agreed with the results generated by the sequencing of full genomes and defined additional sequence groupings within an existing MERS-CoV clade. With the addition of more genomes over time from both humans and from DCs, two clades have become apparent; A and B. Clade A contains only human-derived MERS-CoV genomes ( Fig. 4) .\\nTo date, the MERS-CoV genomes collected from samples spanning just two years are genetically very similar to each other. An alignment of 56 complete or near-complete MERS-CoV genomes sampled from 2012 to 2014 differed by 0-0.38%. For comparison, an alignment of 31 complete HCoV-NL63 genomes from samples collected between 1983 and 2009 shows they diverge by 0.5% at the nucleotide level (data not shown; theoretically equates to 145nt for a 27,553nt genome). There is as yet no study which attaches clinical relevance to the clades or smaller groupings of MERS-CoV nor any of the genomic variation noted to date . It is interesting that Clade A contains only the African green monkey kidney (Vero; innate immune deficient cells) cell-culture passaged EMC/2012 variant and two variants of the Jordan-N3 variant from 2012, but no camel-derived MERS-CoV genomes . When the MERS-CoV genome of the variant from Bisha was re-sequenced directly from the original URT sample, the comparison of trimmed genomes (EMC/2012 vs. Bisha 1) revealed 115 nucleotide differences (0.38% difference) resolving Bisha 1 into Clade B . This is unusual because when a Jordan-N3 virus was intentionally serially passed through Vero or MRC5 cell culture (Jordan-N3/2012 MG167), only 2nt changes occurred within the entire coding region of the resultant sequence, despite eight passages (Frey et al., 2014) . For comparison, after three passages through Vero cell culture, no genetic changes were found in a DC MERS-CoV variant of Qatar 2 2014 .\\nA very divergent MERS-CoV variant originated from an Egyptian DC likely imported from Sudan was identified as NRCE-HKU205|Nile|2013. It constructs a lineage outside the current clades, perhaps comprising the first occupant of Clade C Cotten et al., 2013b; Smits et al., 2015) . This lineage may represent additional diversity of MERS-CoV variants remaining to be discovered in DC from outside the Arabian peninsula. A virus sequenced from a Neoromicia capensis bat was more closely related to MERS-CoV than previous bat sequences had been, providing a link between human, camel and bat viruses as members of the same CoV species . Despite usually comprising ≤1% of the total genome, in silico comparison shows that viral genetic changes among variants permit geographic tracking of the spread of variants and identification that Riyadh, in particular, harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants ( Fig. 4) . This process of molecular epidemiology can also imply some physical direction to the movement of MERS-CoV around the region and over time (Cotten et al., 2014) .\\nWhen compared to Bisha 1 2012, most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome, encompassing the S protein (Fig. 5 ) and accessory proteins . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes harbour amino acid substitutions in the ribosome binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and codons 158 (N-terminal region), 460 (RBD), 1020 (in heptad repeat 1), 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change (Cotten et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) . Studies are needed to determine whether there any functional outcomes on virus replication and transmission due to these and future changes (Cotten et al., 2014 ). An early in vitro analysis did not find differences in shedding, replication or immune escape among viruses isolated up to May 2014 . The location and crystal structure of the RBD was described in several reports from mid-2013 Du et al., 2013b; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) .\\nEarly diagnostic methods appeared within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case. These included Vero and LLC-MK2 cell culture and several in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 6 ) (Corman et al., 2012a,b; Zaki et al., 2012) . Antibody testing of human sera remains rare.\\nRT-rtPCR assays validated by Corman et al. were quickly recommended by the WHO having been shown to be sensitive The genetic relationship between all near-complete and complete MERS-CoV genome nucleotide sequences (downloaded from GenBank using the listed accession numbers; England2 was obtained from http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/MERSCoV/respPartialgeneticsequenceofnovelcoronavirus/%5D). This neighbour joining tree was created in MEGA v6 using an alignment of human and DC-derived MERS-CoV sequences (Geneious v6). The tree was rooted using NRCE-HKU205 CAMEL KJ477102. Clades are indicated next to dark (Clade A) or pale (Clade B) blue vertical bars. Camel icons denote genomes from DC. MERS-CoV sequences described as originating from the same patient either before (Bisha 1) or after (EMC/2012) passage in cell culture are starred (red). Identical genomes from a human and one of his ill camels from Jeddah (Azhar et al., 2014a) , the KSA are also starred (yellow). Healthcare or community outbreaks are boxed (blue, green, pink) and labelled. and specific (Corman et al., 2012a,b) . The target sequences of the recommended screening assays remained conserved among genomes until at least mid-2014 when last checked by IMM (Fig. 6) .\\nRT-rtPCR on the upstream E region (upE; Fig. 6 6 . A schematic depicting the location of primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) for the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays (Corman et al., 2012a,b performed the Hajj in 2013, with no cases being identified (Memish et al., 2014d) . This may reflect the absence of MERS-CoV, no LRT testing (Memish et al., 2014d) or that 61% of pilgrims were arriving from countries without any known MERS-CoV circulation. Similarly, no MERS-CoV was identified during the 2012 in Hajj among the nasal swabs from 154 pilgrims tested by RT-rtPCR (Corman et al., 2012a) before leaving for and departing from, the KSA nor from 114 swabbed pilgrims with influenza-like illness in the KSA during the Hajj in 2013 (Barasheed et al., 2014; Gautret et al., 2013) . Across a period of rapid case accumulation and intense screening in Jeddah during March to July 2014 (called the Jeddah-2014 outbreak hereafter), ∼5000 samples were tested in a month yielding ∼140 MERS-CoV detections (∼3% prevalence) (MERS, 2014g). Among 5065 individuals sampled and tested across the KSA between 1st October 2012 and 30th September 2013, 108 (2.1%) detections were made using the upE and ORF 1a assays. This was a hospitalcentric population which included hospitalised cases (n = 2908), their families (n = 462) and associated HCWs (n = 1695) . Among the detections, 19 were HCWs and 10 were family contacts . During times of high MERS-CoV activity, its 2-3% prevalence is not very different from a more hospital-based prevalence for other HCoVs (Mackay et al., 2012) . Given the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV, it is not a virus that should reasonably be described as a \"storm in a teacup\", however to date it has been given many \"opportunities\" for worldwide spread and it has not yet taken any of them.\\nData have shown one or more RT-rtPCR negative URT samples from clinically suspect MERS cases may be contradicted by further URT sampling or the preferred use of LRT samples (Bermingham et al., 2012; Omrani et al., 2013) . Higher viral loads occur in the LRT compared to the URT, especially with increasing time from onset of symptoms (CDC, 2014; Drosten et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b) . Since the majority of disease symptoms appear to have been manifesting as systemic and LRT disease, this may not be surprising (Assiri et al., 2013a) . However at writing, no human data exist to define whether the virus replicates solely in the LRT, the URT, has a preference for one over the other, or replicates in other human tissues in vivo. Sampling of the URT has been frequently noted from the largest human MERS-CoV investigative studies (Gautret et al., 2013 ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; Memish et al., 2014b,d) and, if noted, for other smaller investigative MERS-CoV testing (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013b) . In a macaque monkey model, MERS-CoV RNA was shed from both the URT and LRT (deWit et al., 2013) . In a human case, throat swabs were positive for six days, and again after a gap (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . In another case, a 40-year old female HCW shed MERS-CoV RNA from the URT (Ziad A. Memish, personal communication) for at least 42-days between April and June 2014 (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014) . She did not show signs of disease during her time shedding virus. In a study of MERS cases in an intensive care setting, three of 12 patients shed virus for 12-22 days (Arabi et al., 2014) . Elsewhere, viral RNA was detected in human oronasal swabs for 16 days and in pharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates for 24 days . Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their lower respiratory tract specimens (tracheal aspirates and sputum) for at least 30 days while only 30% of contacts were still shedding RNA in their upper respiratory specimens (Memish et al., 2014e) .\\nThe LRT is a WHO-recommended sampling site for MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR testing, especially when collection of samples will be delayed by a week or more after symptom onset (World Health Organization, 2013b) . Samples to test include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal/tracheobronchial aspirate, pleural fluid and sputum (CDC, 2014; World Health Organization, 2013b) . Fresh samples yield better diagnostic results than refrigerated material and if delays of ≥72 h are likely, samples (except for blood) should be frozen at −70 • C (CDC, 2014). Lung biopsy or autopsy tissues can also be tested if available (World Health Organization, 2013b) . From the URT, which is a less invasive and convenient sampling site, a combined nose and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate is recommended (CDC, 2014) . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is preferred if collected two weeks after onset of disease (World Health Organization, 2013b).\\nUrine has been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 and 13 days after symptom onset and stool samples were RT-rtPCR positive up to 16 days after onset Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) ; both sample types should be considered (CDC, 2014; World Health Organization, 2013b) . In two cases that arrived in the Netherlands, urine was RT-rtPCR negative but faeces was weakly positive while sera were RT-rtPCR positive for five days or more (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . MERS-CoV viral RNA detection in serum has proven a useful retrospective source of PCR template when respiratory samples were not available (Hijawi et al., 2013) . RNAaemia may also correlate with disease severity; signs of virus cleared from serum in one recovered human case while lingering until the death of another (Faure et al., 2014) .\\nIn a study of different sample types (64 nasopharyngeal [NPA], 30 tracheal aspirates, 13 sputa and 3 BAL), tracheal aspirates and BAL returned the best viral load values followed by NPA and sputum, which generally equated with whole genome sequencing success (Memish et al., 2014c) . This represents the only study of the effect of sample type on molecular analysis and it confirmed both the importance of LRT sampling for whole genome sequencing, while noting that 57% of samples from 112 distinct patients in the KSA in fact originated from the URT (Memish et al., 2014c) .\\nMany studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic human respiratory viruses or bacteria (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Devi et al., 2014) . When viruses are sought, they include some of the following: human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs), influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) and metapneumovirus (MPV) and co-detections with MERS-CoV do occur (Bermingham et al., 2012; Drosten et al., 2013 ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; Memish et al., 2013b) . When included, other viruses are often absent in the samples positive for MERS-CoV Bermingham et al., 2012; Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2013) but have been found in samples negative for MERS-CoV during such rare MERS investigations (Reuss et al., 2014) . Tests on the first human case in the KSA used a LRT sample to isolate MERS-CoV in culture, conduct immunofluorescence for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for other viruses (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) . RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. A case exported to Greece in April-2014 was tested (and found negative) for IFVs, Legionella and Pneumococcus . Other bacterial testing has been conducted but the impact of bacterial copresence is also unclear Devi et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013b; Tsiodras et al., 2014) . Two MERS cases that travelled from the KSA to the Netherlands were negative for RSV, AdV, bocavirus (BoV), PIVs, HCoVs, HRV, IFVs, RSV and MPV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Testing for other respiratory pathogens is strongly recommended (World Health Organization, 2013b) but limited data address the occurrence of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both cases and contacts suspected of MERS-CoV infection. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses including endemic other human coronaviruses.\\nDespite widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a source for MERS-CoV, no strategic and widespread sero-surveys have been conducted in humans using samples collected post-2012. The development of robust serological assays hinges on the accessibility of a reliable panel of well-characterised animal or human sera including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV and to likely agents of cross-reaction . Obtaining these control materials has been problematic and has slowed the development and commercialization of assays for human testing . One company has produced an ELISA kit to detect IgG in camels using a recombinant S1 receptor-binding subunit of MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen and produces a diagnostic reagent for immunofluorescence EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AGf, 2014) . Serosurveys are essential to determine a baseline of animal and community exposures to MERS-CoV among countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Early sero-surveys of humans used conventional immunofluorescent assays (IFA) in which antibodies, if present in patient sera, attach to MERS-CoV infected cell cultures to identify the presence of IgG, IgM or neutralising antibodies (Corman et al., 2012b; Drosten et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . No sign of MERS-CoV antibody was found among 2400 sera from patients visiting the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, KSA from 2010 through 2012 , and no sign of prior MERS-CoV infection was found among 130 healthy blood donors screened at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah (collected between January and December 2012). Eight of 226 slaughterhouse workers were positive by IFA, but those results could not be confirmed by neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of cross-reactive antigen by IFA (Aburizaiza et al., 2014 ). An absence of MERS-CoV antibodies among slaughterhouse workers may reflect the killing of older DCs which are less often MERS-CoV positive (see Table 1 ), the rarity of infected animals, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs (Aburizaiza et al., 2014) , a weak immune response by humans who do not get severe MERS, or an overall low risk of MERS-CoV transmission by contact. IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera which could not be resolved by an NT test (Chan et al., 2013b) . The need for well-validated assays was further emphasised when publicly released MERS-CoV antibody test results indicated that a handshake and two face-to-face meetings were sufficient for MERS-CoV transmission between two people in the USA (CDC Newsroom, 2014; Sampathkumar, 2014) . These results were subsequently retracted because they did not withstand further confirmatory analysis with the less rapid, but highly specific, NT assay (CDC Newsroom, 2014) .\\nA more biologically safe IFA was developed that did not require infectious virus but was instead based on transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV N and S genes (Corman et al., 2012b; Reuss et al., 2014) . Recombinant lentiviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein and luciferase are also safer and simpler diagnostic alternatives to working with infectious MERS-CoV Zhao et al., 2013) . A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread use in animal studies and is at least as sensitive as the microneutralization (MNT) test (Hemida et al., 2013 (Hemida et al., , 2014a (Hemida et al., , 2015 Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013b) . In a study of sera collected at the King Fahd Hospital, Eastern region of the KSA (158 from children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011 and 110 from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors) no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibody could be found using the ppNT assay (Gierer et al., 2013) . Similarly, in a study of four herdsmen in contact with an infected DC herd in Al-Ahsa, eight people who had intermittent contact with the herd, 30 veterinary surgeons and support staff who were not exposed to the herd, three unprotected abattoir workers in Al-Ahsa and 146 controls who were not exposed to camels in any professional role, none had serological evidence of past MERS-CoV infection using the ppNT assay (Hemida et al., 2015) .\\nMERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results.\\nA study of such cases is an important missing link for interpretation of these negative human serology data. A Jordanian outbreak of acute LRT disease in a hospital in Al-Zarqa in 2012, which predated the first KSA case of MERS, was retrospectively found to have been associated with MERS-CoV infection, initially via RT-rtPCR, but subsequently, and on a larger scale, using positivity by ELISA and IFA or MNT test Hijawi et al., 2013; Payne et al., 2014) . The ELISA used a recombinant N protein from the group 2 betacoronavirus (Pipistrellus) bat-CoV HKU5 to identify antibodies against the equivalent cross-reactive MERS-CoV protein and was validated using 545 sera including some from people known to have had previous HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HRV, HMPV or influenza A(H1N1) infections . A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing (see Table 1 ) (Reusken et al., 2013a) but not for human screening to date. Using the most immunogenic portion or subunit of a specific viral antigen is considered the best approach for producing reliable serological assays . Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray (Reusken et al., 2013a) has usually been followed by confirmatory IFA and/or a plaque-reduction neutralization (PRNT) test (Aburizaiza et al., 2014; Drosten et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) or MNT test Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) . The confirmatory methods ensure the antibodies detected using more subjective screening methods that may also employ a spectrum of potentially cross-reactive antigens, are able to specifically neutralise the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs (bovine CoV, BCoV) or humans (HC0V-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV).\\nEarly work identified that a range of cells underwent cytopathic changes when infected with MERS-CoV in culture. These included cells from (Eckerle et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012; Zielecki et al., 2013) :\\n• human tracheobronchial epithelium, • human primary renal epithelium, • African green monkey kidney (Vero and Vero E6; IFN-deficient),\\n• rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2),\\n• human bronchial epithelium (Calu-3).\\nMERS-CoV grows more efficiently than SARS-CoV in primary bronchial cells and in primary kidney cells (Eckerle et al., 2013) .\\nOther cells or cell lines that support MERS-CoV transcription include Muller et al., 2012) :\\n• porcine kidney cancer (PS), • human kidney cancer (769-P), • human alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549), • bat kidney (Rousettus aegyptiacus, RoNi/7; Pipistrellus pipistrellus, PipNi/1 and PipNi/3; Carollia perspicillata, CarNi/1), • bat lung (Rhinolophus landeri, RhiLu; Myotis daubentonii,\\nDC umbilical cord (TT-R.B) and bat kidney (PipNi) hosted MERS-CoV replication detected by RT-PCR and those from goat also produced the greatest amount of viable virus, followed by monkey, human, alpaca and bat cells . MERS-CoV N protein was produced by a range of infected mammalian cells including (Chan et al., 2013a,c) :\\n• human ex vivo bronchial and lung tissue, • Calu-3, • embryonic foetal lung fibroblasts (HFL), • gastrointestinal (Caco-2), • liver (Huh-7), • kidney (HEK), • histiocytoma (His-1), • porcine kidney (PK-15),\\n• civet lung (CL-1), • monkey kidney (LLC-MK2, Vero, Vero E6).\\nSome cell lines did not support MERS-CoV growth, including (Chan et al., 2013a; Muller et al., 2012) :\\n• baby hamster kidney (BHK), • African green monkey kidney (MA104),\\nKidney cells are a common source of passaged cell lines used in virology and they feature prominently in the list of MERS-CoVpermissive cell lines. It is noteworthy that diabetes is also one of the underlying diseases among two thirds of MERS-CoV positive people and that renal damage features among patients with severe disease (Assiri et al., 2013a) . When a pseudovirus expressing the MERS-CoV S protein was used to examine the binding of S to the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACE2), MHV (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule; CEACAM1) or HCoV-229E (CD13) which were expressed in nonpermissive 293T cells, it did not enter those cells, indicating these were not the receptor molecules for MERS-CoV . When ACE2 was expressed in otherwise non-permissive BHK cells, only SARS-CoV could infect them (Muller et al., 2012) . Additionally, blockade of ACE2 by antibodies only prevented SARS-CoV infection of cells otherwise permissive to that virus while MERS-CoV could still infect them (Muller et al., 2012 ).\\nAn extract from cells permissive for MERS-CoV infection (Huh-7 and Vero) yielded a ∼110 kDa protein bound by a recombinant MERS-CoV S protein domain S1. It was identified by mass spectrometry as the exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26), a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein . The receptor\\'s identity was confirmed by the use of soluble DPP4 to competitively inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero cells as well as by transient expression of DPP4 in COS-7 cells which rendered them permissive to MERS-CoV (Memish et al., 2014f; Raj et al., 2013) . Anti-DPP4 antibodies also blocked human and DC MERS-CoV variants from infecting otherwise permissive human bronchial epithelial cells or Huh-7 cells respectively while inhibitors of the DPP4 function did not, indicating that structure, rather than function, was important for MERS-CoV attachment .\\nDPP4 RNA-positive cells were detected by RT-PCR derived from goat lung, alpaca kidney, camel umbilical cord, bat kidney, human lung and monkey kidney . DPP4 protein was also found on epithelial cells of different species from organs including the kidney and renal ducts, small intestine, lung, umbilical cord, liver, prostate, activated leukocytes and in elevated levels in a soluble form in the blood of those with allergic asthma (Lun et al., 2007; Raj et al., 2013) . Limited DPP4 expression was found in the lung of MERS-CoV non-permissive animals including mice and Syrian hamsters, but it was present. DPP4 expression was also seen in ferret, DC, sheep, goat and cow bronchial/bronchiolar tissues and renal tubular tissues (Coleman et al., 2014b; van Doremalen et al., 2014) . When the structure of DPP4 from animals was modelled, a host-barrier restriction was predicted to exist among different mammals; DPP4 was present but some animals do not support MERS-CoV infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014) . When a human DPP4 was \"hamsterized\" by exchanging five key MERS-CoV Sprotein-interacting residues and introduced into non-permissive BHK cells, they were not rendered permissive, whereas introduction of the human DPP4 into BHK cells successfully permitted their infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014) . Because of the high affinity of MERS-CoV for human DPP4, similar to that for animal DPP4 molecules, it is possible that the MERS-CoV which was detected in humans in 2012 was already modestly adapted to humans and that both DCs and horses, and to a lesser extent goats, should all be considered as sources for intrusion of the virus into human populations because of their degree of binding affinity (Barlan et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) . To date, no sign of natural MERS-CoV infection has been found in goat, sheep, cow or alpaca, despite small seroprevalence studies. However, the DPP4 data suggest the possibility and these animals should be further examined as potential animal hosts (see Table 1 for detail on DCs).\\nAsthmatics have been identified among MERS patients. DPP4 secretion may decrease in proportion to the level of cellular inflammation and the molecule has a role in T-cell activation and hence immune regulation (Boonacker and Van Noorden, 2003) , which may be important for asthmatic airway and MERS-CoV infection. While few studies have looked at DPP4 in the URT and none did so in relation to MERS-CoV, relevant enzymatic activity has been identified there and shown to decrease in the nasal mucosa of patients with rhinitis (inflammation), returning to normal after treatment and/or improvement (Grouzmann et al., 2002) .\\nTo date, the RBD of MERS-CoV have not undergone noteworthy genetic change, which could indicate that the RBD is not a crucial factor for species adaptation (Barlan et al., 2014) , or that time spent in humans has been too short to see such change develop. There is wide genetic diversity among the DPP4 sequences from different animal species, but those with the strongest affinity for MERS-CoV recombinant S protein are more closely related and have the most conservation among 14 amino acids within the human DPP4 sequence predicted to come into contact with the S protein (Barlan et al., 2014) .\\nAutopsy material is not available from fatal MERS cases however such material reflects mostly late stage disease in patients who received numerous therapies and have spent time under mechanical ventilation (Chan et al., 2013c) . Therefore a disease model system is essential to study pathogenesis without the confounding influence of a raft of supportive medical procedures and of pre-existing chronic disease.\\nNeither mice nor Syrian hamsters have supported natural MERS-CoV replication (Coleman et al., 2014b; Drosten, 2013) . To get around the divergence between murine and human DPP4, a mouse model was constructed by introducing a human DPP4 gene ). An adenoviral vector carrying the gene transduced cells in the mouse airway resulting in animals that were receptive to MERS-CoV infection for 17-22 days. Infection induced pneumonia in the animals and viral clearance followed 6-8 days after infection . The model found limited cross-protection afforded by prior exposure to SARS-CoV. Using this model, a Venezuelan equine encephalitis-based replicon expressing MERS-CoV spike protein was shown to be an efficacious vaccine candidate, producing a protective immune response . Subsequently a transgenic mouse model was created in which the human DPP4 was globally expressed resulting in a fully permissive model of severe MERS (Agrawal et al., 2015) . A report of a mouse model for infection by a MERS-CoV close relative, batCoV HKU5, noted that vaccine designs for any emerging CoV should include elements from that particular virus since different members of the same genus are insufficiently similar to elicit immunological crossprotection . Use of transduced knockout mice revealed that TLR-dependent and IFN-signalling pathways were important for control of MERS-CoV replication . Pre-infection delivery of poly I:C, IFN␤ or IFN␥ speeded the clearance of MERS-CoV from infected mice and did so more effectively than if poly I:C was given post-infection . IFN␣2b given with ribavirin improved clinical status and virological control in macaques, in association with reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers and viral load . T-cells were shown to be necessary for virus clearance in mice and immunodominant epitopes attracting CD8 T-cell responses are present in the MERS-CoV S protein ). The mouse model has shown that immune-deficient mice succumbed to more severe disease, as do humans with comorbidities that may affect their immune function.\\nTo date the only non-transduced animal model for MERS-CoV infection is the rhesus macaque monkey; an expensive animal to house and work with. A multi-site infection protocol delivered 7 × 10 6 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV to 6-12 year old macaques via a combination of intranasal, oral, ocular and intratracheal routes attempting to recreate the disease seen in humans (Yao et al., 2014) . This resulted in a transient mild-to-moderate clinical disease, including a leucocytosis, with acute localised-to-widespread radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia . Three days after infection, viral RNA was detected in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa and also at day six in the tonsils, trachea, bronchus, mediastinal lymph nodes and lung, but mostly at reduced levels to those from day three (deWit et al., 2013) . By day six, virus was mostly undetectable in the URT, generally decreasing in quantity by day three and at its highest load one day after inoculation (deWit et al., 2013) . This is much shorter than has been found when serial samples from a human case were analysed (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Shedding from the respiratory tract continued until day six in two of three macaques (deWit et al., 2013) . Levels of viral RNA remained high in BAL samples on day one and three (deWit et al., 2013) . Virus or viral RNA was not found in the kidney, nor were pathological kidney changes or kidney failure noted among macaques (deWit et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014) . Microarray analysis of MERS-CoV infected macaque samples identified a rapid innate immune activation with increased expression of genes involved in proinflammatory processes and cell recruitment including interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemokine C-X-C ligand 1 (CXCL1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (deWit et al., 2013) . By day six post inoculation, gene expression in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung had returned to baseline (deWit et al., 2013) . While the viral dosage and spread of delivery may be unrealistic, we have since learned that much milder disease is not uncommon among MERS-CoV-positive humans, especially those who are younger and do not have underlying comorbidities. The macaque model fulfilled the need to see a purified viral preparation produce disease akin to that seen among some human cases . The direct LRT component of virus delivery in this model likely reflects some proportion of the human route of virus acquisition and some of the notable human disease involving the LRT. However, it may also bias against study of any potential URT response to first contact between virus and host and therefore overlook routes of ingress and the length and nature of the prodrome. While MERS-CoV is believed to the cause of MERS in humans, such causality can only be extrapolated from these studies in the macaque model .\\nMERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were compared using human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. These comprised bronchial epithelial cells that had been differentiated at the air liquid interface to contain basal, secretory, columnar and ciliated cells that generated mucous (Kindler et al., 2013) . This system aimed to recreate the main epithelial lining which is possibly the site of first contact between host and MERS-CoV (Kindler et al., 2013) . Pre-treatment of cultures with interferon ␣ (IFN␣) and IFN␥3 proved effective at reducing the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E (Kindler et al., 2013) . When IFN␣ or IFN␤ was added to ex vivo bronchial or lung tissues one hour after MERS-CoV infection, virus titre and RNA levels decreased more noticeably for MERS-CoV than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also elicited a comparatively poor proinflammatory and cytokine response, but to the same extent as when pre-treated (Chan et al., 2013c) . MERS-CoV failed to induce IFN␤ or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF␣) or to upregulate IL-1␤, MCP-1 or regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA (Chan et al., 2013c) . However, MERS-CoV was perhaps a better replicator in these tissues than SARS-CoV and it\\'s targeting of Type I and Type II alveolar cells within the lungs indicated its potential to hinder lung regeneration after infection, since Type II cells are important for repair (Chan et al., 2013c) . By comparison, HCoV-229E, a generally more mild pathogen, did not replicate in lung tissue while influenza A(H5N1) virus, known to be associated with viral pneumonia, did (Chan et al., 2013c) .\\nFurther immunobiological analysis using cell lines supported that MERS-CoV grows better, but is more sensitive to IFN␤, than SARS-CoV. MERS-CoV is also a very weak inducer of IFN, most likely through an immune dampening effect that both it and SARS-CoV mediate via retention of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Zielecki et al., 2013) . MERS-CoV was again shown to be more sensitive to IFN␤, although this was based on pre-treatment of cells, a situation that does not mimic clinical reality for human cases of MERS (Zielecki et al., 2013) . Kindler et al. noted that the comparatively limited transcriptional response after infection of HAE cultures by any CoV, with no induction of IFN␤ and only mild induction of proinflammatory cytokines, may mean that MERS-CoV is already adapted to growing in these cells (Kindler et al., 2013) . Professional cytokine-producing cells such as plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells and macrophages were lacking in the HAE system but were present in the ex vivo tissues above. These cells are needed to see the full extent of the immune response to CoVs (Kindler et al., 2013) . Use of an embryonal lung fibroblast cell line (HFL), to allow growth of HCoV-229E, identified more IFN␤ and IP-10 induction than that by MERS-CoV. In polarised Calu-3 cells, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV differed in their elicitation of cytokine gene transcription (Lau et al., 2013) . In a three-way virus comparison of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, 15 cellular mRNAs were analysed in response to type I IFN and type III IFN and CoV infection (Kindler et al., 2013) . Proinflammatory gene (IL-1␤, IL-6 and IL-8) mRNA (and IL-8 protein) levels were increased in MERS-CoV infections compared to SARS-CoV, while innate antiviral genes (TNF␣, IFN␤ [and protein] and IP-10) were comparatively decreased from 30 h post-infection (Lau et al., 2013) . Apart from a reduced innate antiviral response, timing of the response also differed, with MERS-CoV appearing to delay cytokine induction. MERS-CoV produced less IL-8 or IFN␤ at 48 h compared to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV also grew less efficiently and destructively than MERS-CoV in Calu-3 cells, as it did in primary bronchial and primary kidney cells and it took longer to reach peak viral production (Eckerle et al., 2013; Kindler et al., 2013) .\\nThe growth of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was also compared in cell cultures including primary undifferentiated human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (HTBE), Calu-3, Vero, human embryonic kidney (293) and in A549 cells. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV grew with similar kinetics in Calu-3 cells (Zielecki et al., 2013) , but Josset et al. noted MERS-CoV induced more significant cytopathic changes accompanying earlier and distinctive changes to the global transcriptome (Josset et al., 2013) . Fourteen-fold more differentially expressed genes were noted from MERS-CoV; uniquely down-regulated genes related to antigen presentation and lymphocyte signalling and up-regulated related to cAMPmediated signalling and ubiquitination (Josset et al., 2013) . The increased relative growth of SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells compared to using HAE cultures above might reflect the latter\\'s variable expression of the SARS-CoV receptor (Josset et al., 2013 (Josset et al., 2013; Kindler et al., 2013) . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV upregulated viral recognition and innate immune pathway activation genes (IL17-related and interferon regulatory factor [IRF]) and down-regulated metabolic genes (Josset et al., 2013) . Because of the rapidity of MERS-CoV host cell expression changes, post-infection treatment with a kinase inhibitor was not as effective as pre-treatment (Josset et al., 2013) , reinforcing the challenges faced in treatment of MERS cases who present once disease processes are well engaged.\\nMERS-CoV has been shown to infect and replicate within primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and produce considerable virus, in contrast to SARS-CoV which could enter, but not propagate within dendritic cells (Zhou et al., 2014) . Interestingly, MERS-CoV antigens were not found to co-localise with macrophages in infected ex vivo lung tissue (Chan et al., 2013c) . In contrast to the work in the HAE system, dendritic cell infection resulted in up-regulation of IFN␣ (though not IFN␤) and of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF␣ and IL-6 (Zhou et al., 2014) . Also, infection triggered significantly higher levels of IP-1o and RANTES than the equivalent dose of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2014) . In clinical practice, two MERS patients in France were found to differ in their IFN␣ responses (Faure et al., 2014) . Patient 1, who died, did not mount a robust type I IFN response while Patient 2, who survived, did mount a response; particularly notable in Patient 1 was the absence of IFN␣ and comparatively little RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF7, IL-12 and IFN␥ (Faure et al., 2014) . IFN␣ promotes the antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response to clear virus. Patient 1 also had a comparatively increased level of IL-1o (with its immunosuppressive role (Sabat, 2010) ), a spike in CXCL10 (a proinflammatory role) late in the course of disease and both patients had raised IL-17A (also proinflammatory).\\nThese immune studies raise questions about whether age and immune status or genetic disorders which affect IFN signalling and production could be a risk factor for severe MERS or whether the actions of MERS-CoV itself are sufficient to interfere with signalling.\\nAn animal as source and intermediate host(s) were considered very early on in the MERS outbreak with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs (Albarrak et al., 2012; ProMED, 2012; Reuss et al., 2014) . While unclear at that time, approximately 12 MERS-CoV detections from a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin between June and August 2013 were possibly triggered by the index case having had DC contact (Memish et al., 2014g) . Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health (OIE) as an emerging disease (2014f) . Animal contact with humans was defined in a summary of the first MERS cases as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition through a droplet-based route, which is still assumed to be the most common route for acquisition of a virus that predominantly causes respiratory disease (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . Providing some support for a droplet transmission route, one report identified viral RNA in an air sample collected in a barn housing an infected DC (Azhar et al., 2014b ). The precise route by which humans acquire MERS-CoV remains unproven. From early on and continuing throughout the MERS epidemic in the KSA, older human males have featured prominently, especially among index cases, implying behavioural factors may play a role (Penttinen et al., 2013) , and these factors may provide important clues as to why so few human cases report DC contact and are reported to have had contact with an infected human, leaving this group without any obvious route of acquisition (Fig. 7) . Whether the above definition of animal contact is sufficient to capture exposure to this respiratory virus remains unclear. Cases are sometimes listed in WHO disease notices as being in proximity to camels or farms, but individuals may have denied coming into contact with the animals. No alternative path for acquiring infection is reported in many of these instances. Fewer than half of human cases have reported camel contact (Gossner et al., 2014) but what constitutes a definition of \"contact\" during these interviews is unclear. In a May 2014 WHO update and risk assessment, specific wording focused on consumption of camel products while equivalent wording was not used to ascribe risk to a potential droplet route for acquisition of MERS-CoV from DC. For example:\\n\"Until more is understood about MERS, people at high risk of severe disease (those with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons), should take precautions when visiting farms and markets where camels are present. These precautions include: avoiding contact with camels; not drinking raw camel milk or camel urine; and not eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked\" (World Health Organization, 2014c).\\nDespite the early evidence of DC contact, the diversity of coronaviruses known to exist among bats made them a more widely discussed initial focus (Fig. 7) (Shi, 2013; Smith and Wang, 2013; Woo et al., 2009) . Nonetheless, to date the only MERS-CoV-specific data pointing to bats originate with a 190nt amplified fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of the MERS-CoV genome identified in the fecal pellet from an insectivorous Emballonuridae bat, Taphozous perforatus, commonly called the Egyptian tomb bat, from Bisha, KSA . While very short, the sequence of the fragment defined it as a diagnostic discovery and at writing no better sequence match exists on the GenBank sequence database. Unfortunately further sequence from this sample could not be obtained because the cold chain was broken when samples shipped to the USA for study thawed and decayed. The role of bats as the natural host of MERS-CoV or the host of a MERS-CoVlike virus remains to be proven.\\nDromedary camels, which make up 95% of all camels, have a central presence in the Arabian Peninsula and human-DC contact ranges from little to close (Gossner et al., 2014; MERS, 2014d) . Camel densities are greatest in and around the horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan (Gossner et al., 2014) . Near the KSA, Yemen has the highest density of camels, and within the country the Ha\\'il region is most densely populated with DCs (Gossner et al., 2014) despite there being no human MERS cases from this region. Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 8) . There are several large wellattended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA (2014d). DC milk and meat are widely collected and consumed and the DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage. However, MERS-CoV infection frequency appears much lower than does the more widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing camel products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurised DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. Apart from its nutritional value, other perceived health benefits and availability, camel milk has been reported as an adjunct to standard type 1 diabetes management (Agrawal et al., 2009; Mohamad et al., 2009) . DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits including a belief that it will keep hair parasite-free and has reported application as an aspirin-like anti-platelet-aggregation substance (Alhaidar et al., 2011) and as a specific anti-cancer and immune modulation substance (Al-Yousef et al., 2012) .\\nIn August 2013, Reusken et al. reported the first sero-survey of livestock living in the region during 2012-2013 (Table 1) (Reusken et al., 2013c) . DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born (originally imported from the Horn of Africa in the 15th century) herd and from Omani DCs (mostly imported in high numbers and with high turnover, from Africa) retired from racing and tested using a protein microarray that expressed a portion of the receptorbinding S1 subunit of the S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Reusken et al., 2013a,c) . A range of other animals was also tested. All non-DC sera tested negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. A neutralising antibody assay found that 10% of strongly seropositive Canary Island DC sera could neutralise the virus while all of the Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralising antibody (Reusken et al., 2013c) . This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus, but its spread to camels beyond these borders remained unclear.\\nSince this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at DCs, and other animals, and the possibility that they may play host to MERS-CoV infection (Table 1 ). Seropositive DCs have been found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa Reusken et al., 2013c Reusken et al., , 2014b . Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids). Many of these animals have only been tested in small numbers and rats, mice, cats, and baboons (wide-ranging in Saudi Arabia and known to come into contact with humans and travel to caves possibly frequented by bats) have yet to be tested at all (Alagaili et al., 2014; Alexandersen et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014b; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013b,c) . In a large study of 1053 sera from equids (horses, donkeys and mules) from the UAE and Spain, none harboured signs of neutralising antibody against MERS-CoV (Meyer et al., 2015) .\\nInitially, serological tools were employed and cautious analysis reported positive DCs as being seropositive to MERS-CoV, or a closely related virus (Alexandersen et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) . Subsequently, diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV RNA and recovery of infectious virus has occurred from DC samples (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014a; Chu et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014a; Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) and from some of these, the full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014a) . These findings confirmed that DC versions of MERS-CoV were at least as similar to and just as genetically phylogentically interleaved, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance (Fig. 4) . Only one other animal, a Taphozous perforatus bat, has contained any traces of MERS-CoV RNA to date .\\nAntibody screening assays sometimes detect cross-reactive antibodies in sera. These are identified as such by screening sera against likely viral culprits, for example BCoV or HCoV-OC43 (as an antigenic facsimile for BCoV). It is possible that other MERS-CoV-like viruses also reside within camels, but this would in no way detract from the current definitive characterization of identical MERS-CoV sequences found in camels.\\nCamel screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often virus or viral RNA positive while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative or if RNA positive in the process of sero-converting, indicative of recent infection (Hemida et al., 2013 (Hemida et al., , 2014a . In adults, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody suggesting re-infection is also possible (Hemida et al., 2014a) . Viral loads among positive camels can be very high (Alagaili et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2013 Hemida et al., , 2014a Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014) and camels have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs (Adney et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014a; Hemida et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) or not obviously unwell. These findings indicate camels can host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored camel sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in camels which date back over two decades (Alagaili et al., 2014; Alexandersen et al., 2014) . Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long camels have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, only introduced to them 20-years ago from bats, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions perhaps occasionally from humans themselves, cannot yet be answered. The next step was to prove a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting camels? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive camel nasal swabs at the farm; six (43%) met the international criteria of being positive by two or more assays . These results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358nt portion of the S gene; these sequences were identical to each other, with close homology to other human and camel MERS-CoV sequences . The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin 1 2013 variant . Subsequently, another case study found evidence of a concurrent human and camel infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners (Azhar et al., 2014a; Drosten et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) . Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive camel had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms (Memish et al., 2014f) . All nine camels in the owner\\'s herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre (Memish et al., 2014f) . A rise in titre theoretically begins 10-21 days after camel infection (Memish et al., 2014f) . While samples were few, the authors of this and a subsequently published study of the same farmer and camel herd in which samples were collected a few days earlier, suggested that the rise in titre in camel sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalised, indicated that the camels were infected first followed by the owner (Azhar et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) . Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) antibodies were also present and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal\\'s antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection (Memish et al., 2014f) .\\nThese studies show that DCs, but perhaps not one of the other animal species tested, are a reservoir for the MERS-CoV by which they seem to be often infected. Camels have been exposed to MERS-CoV, in some way, for at least two decades. It remains unknown whether isolating the reservoir would stop sporadic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans (Nishiura et al., 2014) . When three adult DCs were infected intranasally, intracheally and conjunctivally with 10 7 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV in a study in the United States, an amount similar to that shed by an infected camel, mild URT disease and mostly URT-localised virus replication resulted (Adney et al., 2014) . Infectious virus was also detected in the trachea and one of four lung lobes tested as well as in retropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. URT shedding of infectious virus continued for seven days after inoculation while viral RNA could be detected for 35 days in nasal swabs. Small quantities of viral RNA, but not culturable virus, were detected in exhaled breath but no virus or viral RNA was detected in serum or whole blood and no viral RNA could be detected in faeces or urine for 42 days post inoculation (Adney et al., 2014) . A strong neutralising antibody response was produced by the camels from 14 days post inoculation.\\nWe also do not know whether camels are essential to maintaining chains of human infection which subsequently amplify into more apparent clusters and outbreaks by spreading from humanto-human. Parturition in DCs occurs in the winter months (early in the Gregorian calendar year) which may be a driver of the subsequent spike in human cases seen during 2013 and 2014 (Memish et al., 2014f) . Juvenile camels appear to host active infection more often than adult camels and this may help explain why the slaughter of camels, which must be five years of age or older, does not contribute to significantly to exposure among slaughterhouse workers (Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014) . Small numbers of tested DCs from Australia were not seropositive, but expanded virological investigations of Australian (a source of export) and African camels as well as bats may lead to findings of a more ancestral viral variant or more seropositive animals and geographic areas. Identifying the animal source for zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures Hemida et al., 2013) .\\nThe MERS-CoV genome does not appear to have changed significantly during its movement through humans in 2012-2014, nor during human and camel spillovers; human variants show very little divergence from camel MERS-CoV variants. This implies that the major source for human acquisition is the camel, rather than another animal, but more testing of other animal species is needed to support that conclusion. Over a month, a DC virus sequenced on different occasions, did not change at all genetically, indicating a high level of genomic stability and supporting the possibility that DCs might be the natural, rather than intermediate, host for MERS-CoV we know today (Hemida et al., 2014a) .\\nThe precise role for camels and the route(s) of human acquisition of MERS-CoV from camels in sporadic infections remains to be determined. Nonetheless in the absence of any other likely animal source and in the interest of public health, risk reduction activities now recommend reducing contact with camels, especially when ill, and limiting contact with camel secretions and excretions including the handling of camel milk and meat and the butchering of camels. The potential for aerosol-generation by all these procedures, yet to be defined, described or studied, has not been acknowledged in plain language as a risk to date (see Section 9.1 for aerosols and risk). Thus, camels develop signs of URT disease, shed infectious virus in high quantities in URT secretions and the possibility exists that they may aerosolise that virus.\\nTransmission of MERS-CoV has been defined as sporadic, intrafamilial and healthcare associated (Memish et al., 2014e) . The virus was characterised because of its role in causing severe and therefore more obvious illness in humans; we were the early sentinels highlighting its incursion. Spread of MERS-CoV within families Omrani et al., 2013) and between people has been well documented ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; MERS, 2014b; Puzelli et al., 2013) however the first known MERS outbreak was one of acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting (Hijawi et al., 2013) . This occurred in Al-Zarqa, Jordan and was retrospectively linked to the MERS-CoV after some detailed laboratory and epidemiological analyses (Hijawi et al., 2013) . A BAL and a serum sample from two cases were found to be MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive and a number of probable cases were subsequently added to this outbreak (Hijawi et al., 2013) . Further investigations deployed an ELISA employing the genetically and antigenically similar btHKU5.2 recombinant nucleocapsid antigen (Chan et al., 2013c) , a MERS-CoV Hu/Jordan-N3/2012 infected Vero cell IFA, and an MNT test . These found additional cases from among the sera of 124 subjects . While serology alone does not meet the current WHO definition of a case, optimised and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories do still identify previous occurrences of infection. Just as with PCR testing on occasion, serology usually finds a viral footprint in the absence of any clear signs and symptoms of disease (Knibbs et al., 2014) . And as is also the case with molecular testing, care is needed when moving a newly developed diagnostic serology algorithm from a research setting to one that informs public health decisions (CDC Newsroom, 2014) .\\nFor some time, testing of samples focussed on those collected from patients with severe illness and not on milder acute respiratory tract infections, nor on conducting prospective case-control studies. Contacts of confirmed MERS cases were observed for illness, but, in the absence of signs and symptoms, samples were generally not tested by a laboratory, biasing early data towards more ill and hospitalised patients; often described as just \"the tip of the iceberg\". As testing paradigms changed with increased testing of contacts, more asymptomatic and mild infections were recognised.\\nA rise in the proportion of asymptomatic cases (which enlarges the denominator for calculations of the proportion of fatal cases (Dudley and Mackay, 2013) ) and a drop in the proportion of fatal cases (the numerator) was identified in September 2013 (Penttinen et al., 2013) . Historically, such rises are consistent with changing definitions and laboratory and clinical responses to, and understanding of, a newly discovered virus that was first noted among the severely ill. As adjustments to testing occurred, more cases of milder disease and those with subclinical infections were noted among MERS-CoV positive people. Over time there has been an apparent cyclical pattern to the average weekly age of people positive for MERS-CoV (Fig. 9A ) however the age distribution changed most notably after the Jeddah-2014 outbreak during which a shift towards younger people became evident (Fig. 9B-G) .\\nAs a group, HCWs comprised 19% of MERS-CoV detections and it is apparent from closely following publicly released case data that the weekly proportion of infected HCWs increases dramatically alongside each spike in overall detections (Fig. 10 ). This is explainable because to date, each spike has been intimately associated with healthcare-facility related outbreaks (Penttinen et al., 2013) . These spikes drive observed decreases in average age during each event because afflicted HCWs as well as families are usually younger than inpatients with MERS. Healthcare facilities have therefore been a regular target for suggested improvements aimed at bolstering weaknesses in infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures (Penttinen et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2014f) . In May 2013, the WHO published guidelines for IPC during care of probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in a healthcare setting (World Health Organization, 2013a).\\nThe Jeddah-2014 outbreak was the largest and most rapid accumulation of MERS-CoV detections to date (Fig. 11) with April having the greatest number of MERS-CoV detections of any month on record (Fig. 11B) . The outbreak was mostly (>60% of cases) associated with human-to-human spread within hospital environments, and was thought to have resulted from a lack of, or breakdown in, IPC (Brown, 2014; Zumla and Hui, 2014) . Following the rapid increase in case numbers, a rise in fatalities ensued (Fig. 11A) .\\nGenome sequences indicate viral change, and if the virus is well characterised, such changes may flag alterations to transmissibility, replication, lethality and response to drugs. While genetic sequences examined in 2012 and 2013 showed that multiple variants circulated among people and camels in the KSA , by comparison to the massive genome sequencing approach taken towards tracking Ebola virus transmission and evolution in west Africa during 2014 (Chan et al., 2013b) , only a handful of MERS-CoV genome sequences were reported during 2014, when the majority of all MERS-CoV detections to date occurred. The conclusions about variant diversity in 2014 are extrapolated from these relative few sequences. Those genomes from the Jeddah-2014 outbreak indicated no outstanding genetic or possibly replicative changes from earlier variants World Health Organization, 2014c) . In parallel with the Jeddah-2014 outbreak, another HCW cluster occurred in the UAE. How the index case(s) for either outbreak acquired MERS-CoV remains unknown.\\nGenomic sequence can also be used to define the boundaries of a cluster or outbreak based on the similarity of the variants present among the infected humans and animals and at different healthcare facilities (Fig. 4) (Cotten et al., 2014) . This approach was most clearly seen when defining the geographically constrained hospital MERS outbreak in Al-Ahsa, which occurred between 1st April and 23rd May 2013, as well as clusters in Buraidah and a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin, KSA. Cotton et al. employed molecular epidemiology and found that there had been no sign of transmission chains extending beyond two to three months, so extensive opportunities for the virus adaptation to humans through sustained serial transmission have been infrequent (Cotten et al., 2014) . Sequencing of MERS-CoV genomes from the 2013 Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak indicated that multiple viral variants contributed to the cases but that most were similar enough to each other to be consistent with human-to-human transmission (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Cotten et al., 2013b) . Contact tracing has been described in detail for MERS cases exported beyond the Middle East. Tracing usually identifies dozens of potential cases per confirmed case and while it is a time consuming and expensive process it is essential for understanding transmission and for containing a virus about which little is known. Eighty-three symptomatic or asymptomatic contacts of a case imported to Germany from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) harboured no sign of virus or antibody (Reuss et al., 2014) and similar examples of very limited to no onward transmission have been the hallmark of contact tracing results to date. In a study of 123 contacts of a case imported to France, only seven matched the definition for a possible case and were tested; one who had shared a 20 m 2 room while in a bed 1.5 m apart from the index case was positive and this was determined to be a nosocomial acquisition (Mailles et al., 2013) . It is possible that further mild yet positive cases may have been identified had all contacts been tested regardless of symptoms. No contacts of the first two MERS cases imported into the USA in 2014 tested positive (Bialek et al., 2014) and none among 78 contacts of two cases imported to the Netherlands develop MERS-CoV antibodies (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Apart from clearly defined case studies of nosocomial infection, nosocomial spread is also suspected among a number of MERS cases noted through analysis of public data (author\\'s observations). These are cases admitted to hospital for support of a non-respiratory medical condition, who then develop respiratory symptoms and test positive for MERS-CoV within the incubation period of MERS-CoV infection. One example identified the likely role of a mild or asymptomatic case, present in a hospital during their admission for other reasons, as the likeliest index case for a family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) . Such studies validate the laboratory testing of mild cases when accompanied by a process that restricts exposure of others, especially older family members and friends with underlying disease, to a MERS-CoV infected person.\\nInfectious MERS-CoV added to camel, goat or cow milk and stored at 4 • C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, at 22 • C, for up to 48 h afterwards (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . This is in keeping with HCoV-229E being capable of retaining viability in water for 2 days up to a predicted 588 days depending on the type of water and temperature (Gundy et al., 2009) . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22 • C but pasteurization ablated MERS-CoV infectivity (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of camels from Qatar .\\nPlastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at 20 • C, 47% relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . At 30 • C and 80% RH, MERS-CoV remained viable for 8 h and for 24 h at 30 • C, 30% RH (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . By comparison, influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) could not be recovered in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells beyond 4 h under any conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability decreased by 89% at 70% RH but only decreased 7% at 40% RH when an aerosol was generated at 20 • C while influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) decreased by 62% and 95% respectively (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated by SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2011) however for context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m, thus MERS-CoV\\'s ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient (Knibbs et al., 2014) . Such findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with bioaerosols for transmission of respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration is an important variable in risk measurement and reduction. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions has been emphasised after the Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving camels (urination, defecation, and the processes of preparation and consumption of camel products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and the need to define whether a more stringent level of personal protective equipment should be worn by HCWs and animal handlers remains a priority.\\nWhen the MERS-CoV detection tally sat below 120, analyses of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -the average number of infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population -returned values below 1, indicating that a pandemic was not likely (Bauch and Oraby, 2013; Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014; Poletto et al., 2013) . With more data and correction for observation bias, this conclusion was maintained (Chowell et al., 2014) . These analyses reflected charting of small public data sources and indicated that while cases could climb suddenly, such as during the Al-Ahsa outbreak , the climb was not logarithmic. Methods used in these studies vary but some make allowance for more extensive case numbers than may have been publicly reported (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Poletto et al., 2013) . If R 0 was greater than 1, sustained case climb would be expected. The impact of incomplete case contact tracing, limited community testing and clinically defined cases in the absence of laboratory confirmation might affect some R 0 calculations and make it difficult to identify patterns among case occurrence. The implication is that more positives among these population groups could have occurred and thus a greater transmission efficiency and higher R 0 value may be possible. When narrowing an analysis to index cases (the case with the earliest onset date of a cluster) and inferring secondary case numbers, one study predicted that the R 0 could be slightly above 1.0 (0.8-1.3 with an upper bound of 1.2-1.5 depending on method used) (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . This study hypothesised that a high proportion of infections were not being detected (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . Similar analyses are awaited following the Jeddah-2014 outbreak.\\nMost cases of MERS have resulted from human-to-human transmission, however that transmission was inefficient Memish et al., 2013b; Omrani et al., 2013) and defined as sporadic rather than sustained (Fig. 12) . Based on observational studies, human spread requires close contact to occur. Relevant data are scant but it appears that the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV do not transmit to more than one other human and to date, the localised epidemic of MERS-CoV has not been selfsustaining (Poletto et al., 2013) . Index or sporadic cases have been of age and sex during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak, arbitrarily defined as spanning from the week beginning 17th March 2014 and ending in the week beginning7th July 2014; data are based on laboratory confirmed cases collated into the author\\'s curated line list as at 19th January 2015. Note the changed x-axis scale between B/C and D/E/F/G. Sources of these public data include the World Health Organization, Ministries of Health and FluTrackers (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014). Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal website (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) . (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) .\\nolder and it has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Strategic sero-assays have yet to investigate the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to the MERS-CoV transmission chain. In a household study, 14 of 280 (5%) contacts of 26 MERS-CoV positive index patients were RNA or antibody positive .\\nThere is no specific drug or vaccine currently available to treat infection by the MERS-CoV. For context, there is still no vaccine available against SARS, mostly attributable to the brevity of the SARS-CoV global emergence. It is impossible to predict whether a MERS-CoV vaccine for human use will fall victim to a lack of commercial interest or remain relevant in the time it will take to be developed, however a vaccine for use in camels is a more practical option given the identity shared between human and camel viral variants and the apparent rarity of MERS-CoV spillover to humans. If applied to young camels ahead of their first virus acquisition, such a vaccine may be capable of eradicating MERS-CoV from herds. But if the source of camel infections is bats, newly imported camels or other herds, any vaccine would need to be used in an ongoing manner and be able to reach feral camel herds as well. Care of hospitalised patients remains supportive, with vigilance for complications (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . No empirical use of antimicrobial agents has improved severe disease nor have high dose steroids succeeded in reversing the progression of respiratory disease (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . The development and registration of drugs for human use is not suitably rapid to use effectively against an emerging infectious agent (de Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014) . However, research advances in this area have been made.\\nTesting of formulations previously approved by the Food and Drug Agency (FDA; USA) at the Small-molecule Inhibitor Leads Versus Emerging and neglected RNA viruses (SILVER) project described four existing compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide and lopinavir) that inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E replication in cell culture (de Wilde et al., 2014; SILVER consortium, 2015) . In another study, 33 drugs with the ability to impart >50% inhibition upon MERS-CoV growth in culture have been described as candidates for future clinical MERS intervention studies (Dyall et al., 2014) . These were also identified following investigation of pre-existing, FDA-approved clinical drugs and encompass 13 different classes of therapeutic (Dyall et al., 2014) . A novel molecule, K22, showed promise both directly and as an example that it was possible to target and specifically disrupt very conserved viral replication processes such as double membrane vesicle-associated RNA replication, without causing cellular toxicity (Lundin et al., 2014) .\\nAnother approach has been to target the interface between the MERS-CoV RBD and the receptor by employing competitive substrates or inhibitors of the enzymatic function of DPP4 (Kawalec et al., 2014) . DPP4 inhibitors, in their role as anti-diabetes drugs, already exist, are tolerated and are not associated with adverse events (Kawalec et al., 2014) although it is unclear whether they may already be in use among MERS patients with underlying kidney disease. Additionally, targeting the viral MERS-CoV 3C protease, important for replicase polyprotein maturation, may be a viable strategy in the future because it has so far remained conserved (Cotten et al., 2014) .\\nThe company Novavax has produced an experimental recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate based on the MERS-CoV S protein and it has generated important anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in a mouse model (Coleman et al., 2014a) . Monoclonal antibodies (e.g. MERS-4, MERS-27 and 3B11) directed towards the S protein are capable of neutralising infection by the MERS-CoV and hold future promise for use as a therapeutic and prophylactic Tang et al., 2014) . A replication-competent, propagation-deficient E gene-deleted mutant of MERS-CoV variant EMC/2012 (rMERS-CoV-E) may also prove to be a useful vaccine candidate while a truncated RBD of MERS-CoV has been shown to elicit antibodies in mice (Almazán et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a) . A conserved peptide in the RdRp of all HCoVs was also identified, and that may provide the basis for an epitope-directed universal vaccine (Sharmin and Islam, 2014) .\\nIFN treatment has shown promise in culture-based experiments (MERS, 2014a) but in macaques, early application was required for effectiveness. Macaques were infected with 7 × 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV and, 8 h after infection, they were treated with substantial amounts of subcutaneous IFN-␣2b along with intravenous ribavirin, followed by ribavirin doses intramuscularly every 8 h and with IFN-␣2b every 16 h until 72 h after infection . Treatment prevented any signs of increased respiration, leucocytosis (neutrophilia) or reduction in oxygen saturation seen in the untreated animals plus treated macaques had very little to no radiographic evidence of pneumonia . The viral load in daily BALs did not differ between treated and untreated macaques but loads were reduced in the treated animal\\'s postmortem tissues and fewer tissues were MERS-CoV RT-PCR positive. Since MERS seems to be a prolonged disease that is well engaged (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) . upon presentation for medical help, it is unclear how this drug cocktail could be delivered early enough to moderate severe disease. When trialled on five critically ill patients with comorbidities and a median time between hospitalization and treatment of 19 days (range 10-22 days), no response to treatment was evident . When used as a primary treatment of an infected physician and as prophylaxis for his wife, it was unclear whether the cocktail had any effect (Khalid et al., 2014) .\\nThe WHO took the lead in collating data and providing an official voice for the emergence of MERS from 23rd September 2012 (Hartl, 2013; World Health Organization, 2014b) . Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country\\'s Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States\\' epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory Härtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that \"the more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public\\'s trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality\" (Hartl, 2013) . This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS and MERS-CoV (2014c; Editorial, 2014; Holmes, 2014; Kupferschmidt, 2014; Reuters, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014f) .\\nDespite data in the scientific literature strongly indicating that camels harboured MERS-CoV or a very closely related virus, communication about camels posing a risk to humans as the zoonotic sources for infections did not became a mainstream public health message until late April of 2014; two years after the discovery of the virus. This shift correlated with a change in the KSA Minister of Health, requests for help in containing the Jeddah-2014 outbreak and a new WHO risk assessment, which included mention of camels (World Health Organization, 2014e) . Shortly thereafter, the KSA Deputy Minister for Public Health and lead author of most peerreviewed MERS-CoV research, Professor Ziad Memish, was also asked to step down. However, the message to date, underpinned as it is by a paucity of understanding about how and from where the virus transmits, may not yet capture or adequately communicate all the risks.\\nMuch of what is considered social media is a volatile resource, yet a very valuable one. There is an understanding of the volatility of this non-peer reviewed medium but also a perception that social media is a place only for \"selfies\" and not science. Tweets can disappear to search after a short period, blog pages can come and go and be untraceably altered while online mainstream news stories, in some countries more than others, may suffer similar fates as they rapidly become old news. Despite that, internet-driven information has played a vital role in rapidly tracking and unearthing cases, clusters and outbreaks of disease in recent years. This has been the case for MERS globally. At this stage, many who follow infectious disease clusters, outbreaks and pandemics through social media are well informed by exposure to a distillation of the most recent events, reports, commentary and news stories from all over the world. Professionals who use this communication medium are clearly appreciated by their funding stakeholders, the public. Social media and blogs communicate with a much broader audience than is usually reached by the traditional scientific literature and they are more accessible to the local and global communities who contribute to the funds that researchers so dearly seek. Sometimes these forms of mass communication are useful to those seeking information about a disease outbreak in their own country. Sometimes they are entirely misleading. The public audience may not spend the time and mostly do not have the background expertise to interpret the densely presented, often slow to appear, scientific and public health literature. The space between the scientific literature and mainstream media is occupied by those science communicators who may, sometimes with and sometimes without relevant scientific training, be as up-to-date on their topics as the best academic epidemiologist. The President John F. Kennedy quote, \"One person can make a difference, and everyone should try\" seems an apt one to describe these dedicated people who, often without any paid incentives, devote their personal time, effort and money to better understand and communicate about infectious disease. Frequently updated data repositories such as the small FluTrackers group constantly compile, actively curate and condense worldwide news sources into threads of information that often assemble into patterns that can predict emerging infectious disease events well before they reach the mainstream media, and their line list of MERS-CoV detections (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014) has been a cornerstone of case numbering, detail and clarity; Crawford Kilian\\'s H5N1 blog (Kilian, 2014) outstrips its name by providing links to other reliable sources as well as excerpts and highly eloquent and thought-provoking commentary on a range of microbial infectious disease stories, of which MERS-CoV is just one; Michael Coston\\'s Avian Flu Diary (Coston, 2014 ) also focusses and comments on emerging infectious diseases augmented by astute and experienced public health commentary, resources and a large inventory of past posts that are used to good effect when creating new and informative ones; the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) is an internet-based reporting system maintained by a panel of authoritative professionals and rapporteurs who prepare daily digests of the latest infectious disease happenings which they freely circulate using widely read emails (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, 2014); for a more workforce-oriented view of MERS and infectious disease, Shane Granger\\'s Random Analytics provides an excellent perspective of the less frequently discussed impact of infectious diseases on humans (Granger, 2012) ; my own blog, Virology Down Under seeks to distill some of the more complex virology-related happenings and present data on emerging viral disease in a more graphical, accessible and open access way (Mackay, 1997 (Mackay, , 2013 ; Maia Majumder who applies an engineering systems expertise to the epidemiology of the disease (Majumder, 2014) . These are just a few resources and each is part of an interconnected web of other sources, contacts and personal experience that exist on the internet; they have all chased and tracked the emergence of MERS-CoV as doggedly as a professional science writer. Each resource is as distinct yet complimentary source of information that together are sometimes referred to as flublogia. While it is often overlooked and perhaps underestimated by some professional scientists and clinicians, flublogia compiles or uses publicly available, deidentified data and adds publicly relevant interpretation which is greatly appreciated, much more widely read and far, far more often cited than anything seen in the professional scientific literature. It is also a factual source of such information Salathe et al., 2013) .\\nThe MERS-CoV appears to be an entrenched camel virus infecting the URT which may have its origins among bats. Human infection may result from rare zoonotic spillover to humans. Many potential animal, human and environmental sources await further testing but thanks to quick action, the sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostic tools required to achieve this goal have been in place and available since the virus was made known to the public. Serological tools for research application, after a much slower start, are now emerging as robust, validated and ready for wider use, with care. Commercial unavailability remains an issue for more widespread use and so collaboration with the relevant research groups must be the immediate option for future studies. The MERS-CoV can spread from human-to-human but seems to do so only sporadically and sustained chains of transmission have not been evident to date. There is also no evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern, despite many opportunities for it to become so. But vigilance is key for a virus with a genetic makeup that has only been observed for three years. Of those known to be infected, over a third have died. Central to future vigilance is continued screening, sequencing, analysis and timely data sharing. While whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV, it remains a tool for experts and collaborations have again been key for less equipped or experienced researchers to decode the MERS-CoV as it moves through people, over time and across distance in the KSA and beyond its borders. A recently described routine genotyping target which is equivalently informative will also aid this vigilance. Nonetheless, figures modelling efficiency of transmission will need confirmation once better serological and RT-rtPCR-based studies of humans, covering more of the community, have been conducted. It has become very clear that the MERS-CoV may spread poorly from human-to-human, but that spread is at its most effective around a hospital environment. Indications are that this can be traced back to poor IPC practices and protocols (Brown, 2014; Editorial, 2014; Zumla and Hui, 2014) . The virus has its greatest impact on those with underlying diseases and such cases, sometimes suffering multiple comorbidities, are likely to visit hospital for treatment, creating a perfect storm of exposure, transmission and mortality. Educational programmes will be important tools to combat the spread of MERS-CoV. While MERS and SARS have some similarities they also diverge significantly. Characteristics including the higher PFC among MERS cases (above 50% in 2013 and currently at 30-40%; well above the 9.5% of SARS), the association between fatal disease and older males with underlying comorbidities, the very broad tropism of MERS-CoV, its rapid in vitro growth, rapid induction of cytopathogenic change, robust yet distinct transcriptional responses, use of a different receptor, its induction of a more proinflammatory but reduced and delayed innate antiviral response and its sensitivity to external IFN␣ or IFN␤ all signal differences from SARS-CoV to some degree.\\nMERS has had little direct impact on populations outside the Arabian Peninsula with relatively few cases acquired outside the KSA to date. From those studies conducted thus far that screen people beyond the most severely ill, there appears to be a 2-3% prevalence of MERS-CoV in the KSA with a 5% chance of secondary transmission within the household. Despite two mass gatherings that have afforded the virus many millions of opportunities to spread, there have, remarkably, been no reported outbreaks of MERS or MERS-CoV during or immediately after these events. Nonetheless, hospitals across the KSA continue to describe MERS cases and so the other 22 countries who have experienced MERS and the rest of the world remain on alert for imported cases, especially during and after mass gathering events including Umrah, Ramadan and Hajj pilgrimages.\\nMuch remains unknown about MERS-CoV and MERS. Further cooperative data-sharing and research is needed to address questions which include:\\n• What is the natural host for the MERS-CoV?\\n• Are camels the source of sporadic human infections and if so, why is MERS-CoV seroprevalence among humans working closely with camels, so low? • What is the route of transmission to humans and between humans and what is the best personal protective equipment to be adopted by frontline HCWs? • Which hospital IPC measures are insufficient or insufficiently employed to halt the transmission of MERS-CoV and what is the extent of transmission and clinical impact of, and nosocomial infection by, other co-occurring respiratory viruses in these settings in the KSA? • Why are males more often afflicted than females? Are there differences in activity and exposure that could explain this? What is the prevalence of underlying disease between the sexes? • Does MERS-CoV infection generally result in a subclinical outcome except in those with comorbidities? • Do current serological tools have the sensitivity to detect the immune response to a mild, subclinical or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection? If not, might MERS-CoV be a rare, seasonal and endemic infection of humans like other HCoVs? • For how long does the average period of MERS-CoV shedding continue from infected humans and does this differ with age, sex and vocation? • March and April seem to be when human outbreaks of MERS begin-what are the events occurring in and around this time of year that may increase human exposure to MERS-CoV? • Why does MERS-CoV continue to affect such a wide area of the KSA but in such very low numbers-is there an as-yet-unidentified role for mass gatherings in virus acquisition and subsequent geographic dissemination? • What proportion of acute respiratory tract disease cases continue to go untested because they do not manifest as severe disease and could these clarify gaps in the transmission chains of some cases? • Have cases of MERS been going undiagnosed among people in African countries that are known to host seropositive or viruspositive camels? • Are there divergent MERS-CoV variants and viral clades to be found in camels, humans and bats beyond the Arabian peninsula?\\nThe localised MERS-CoV epidemic reminds us of the importance of communication at all levels and perhaps the need to rethink how stakeholders are informed of the progress of chasing down and studying new disease threats. In May 2014, two cases of MERS-CoV were imported into the USA. A third person was proposed to be the first local transmission event but was subsequently declared a false-positive. These cases served as an excellent example of \"gumshoe epidemiology\" working alongside excellent public communication, comprehensive laboratory support and a well-prepared clinical capacity. Social and mainstream media and press conferences comprehensively informed the public of the extensive findings generated by expert health care supported by laboratory analysis. And yet lessons were still learned about balancing real-time transparency and the need for suitable laboratory confirmation of results. This case highlighted the effectiveness of social media in communicating digestible information to expectant stakeholders compared to the use of a generally slower and more elite peer-reviewed scientific publication pipeline which is often better suited to detailed research description over the long haul, but with some exceptions, a process unsuited for informing a concerned global and always-online public of potential threats to its immediate health or providing context to those threats.\\nHowever, while MERS-CoV is not a rapidly spreading global contagion, it may evolve further to become that or another may emerge in the future and vigilance and rapid communication will be key to a timely response and early containment. Every time a new virus emerges, we learn more, requiring us to re-examine what we previously \"knew\". One constant in all this however is the human; it is we who fan the flames of a disease cluster until it becomes an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Viruses do not emerge and gain a foothold without our aid, or our lapses in vigilance. MERS highlighted that some paradigms can be stumbling blocks to seeking and communicating knowledge and containing and understanding the spread and nature of a virus. It also served as yet another reminder to us that global human and animal health, politics, agriculture and economies are all intimately interwoven and it takes just a single tiny virus to tip a very fine balance.', 'On 23 March 2020, the UK announced the \"stay at home\" order and entered the first national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an enforced isolation can be associated with a subjective feeling of lack of companionship or a mismatch between one\\'s perceived and desired social relationships, which is called loneliness (Reinhardt et al., 2020) . Recent studies among UK residents have found that young adults were at the highest risk of experiencing loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown (Bu et al., 2020; Li & Wang, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) . These studies have focused on the early months of the pandemic, with one study finding that individuals aged between 18 and 29 reported higher levels of loneliness, but experienced a decrease in loneliness from March to May 2020. However, research has yet to examine the trajectory of loneliness for young adults during the summer to winter months of 2020. Given that loneliness levels are likely to vary due to changes in restrictions, along with a possible rise during the winter months (Victor et al., 2015) , this period is an important one to investigate.\\nThe present study examined the trajectory of self-reported loneliness for young adults from June to November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on young adults aged 18 to 25, in line with the theory of emerging adulthood. This theory characterises this period as one of identity explorations, new independence, physical separation from family and friends, intimate relationships, school transitions, and entry into the workforce (Arnett, 2014) . Not surprisingly, this is also the period during which loneliness is often the most prevalent across the lifespan (Qualter et al., 2015) . Being lonely in young adulthood has a range of negative implications, which can persist into later life. Young adults who are lonelier tend to have more mental health problems, engage in more physical health risk behaviours, adopt more negative coping strategies, and have a lower income (Matthews et al., 2019; Von Soest et al., 2020) . In all, existing literature highlights the importance of investigating the factors associated with loneliness in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic for intervention purposes.\\nOne factor that has been identified as an effective coping strategy under the current pandemic is emotional support (Office for National Statistics, 2020). In a sample of more than 35,000 adults in the UK, for instance, Bu and colleagues (2020) found that having more than three close friends was a protective factor against loneliness during the strict lockdown period (March to May 2020). Gender differences have also been shown in the stress-buffering effect of social support for young adults. In a college student sample aged 18-25, for example, Lee and Goldstein (2016) found a greater adverse impact of low levels of emotional support on loneliness in females than in males. The authors concluded that this may be due to females\\' greater sensitivity to lack of support when compared to males.\\nA number of demographic and health factors have further been found to relate to loneliness during the pandemic. COVID-focused studies with UK samples have shown that females and those with low income or who are unemployed were more likely to experience loneliness, whereas those living with a romantic partner were less likely to feel lonely (Bu et al., 2020; Li & Wang, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) . Other important covariates related to increased loneliness during the pandemic include physical and mental health problems (McGlone & Long, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) .\\nDrawing upon a longitudinal, representative sample from the Understanding Society Covid-19 survey, the present study used growth curve modelling to assess the trajectory of loneliness among UK young adults (aged 18 to 25) from June to November 2020. Given the increased need for intimate relationships during young adulthood (Qualter et al., 2015) , we expected that self-reported loneliness changes in line with lockdown restrictions. We further examined how self-reported emotional support, demographic and health factors influence the trajectory of self-reported loneliness. In line with previous research (Bu et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) , we expected that those who report more emotional support, live with romantic partners, are employed or in school, and have a larger household income report less loneliness; while those with a physical or mental health condition report more loneliness. Lastly, we investigated whether gender differences emerge in the stress-buffering effect of emotional support on loneliness, with expectations that emotional support has a greater impact on females (Lee and Goldstein, 2016) .\\nThe participants were drawn from the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, which is a national-wide, longitudinal panel survey of UK households taken from the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). The Understanding Society COVID-19 survey focuses on how the pandemic has influenced individuals and families across the UK. The participants were invited from within the main Understanding Society sample, allowing analysis of a large sample that is representative of the population. Ethical approval for the survey was granted by the University of Essex Ethics Committee.\\nThe Understanding Society COVID-19 survey was gathered monthly from April 2020 to June 2020, and then every two months from September 2020. The first four questionnaires were fielded to all members who had completed at least one of the last two waves of the main UKHLS. From Wave 5 onwards, only those who participated in at least one of the first waves of the study were sent the questionnaire.\\nThe present study examined data for 18-25-year-olds collected in June (Wave 3), July (Wave 4), September (Wave 5), and November (Wave 6) 2020. As a quantifiable measure of emotional support was not gathered until Wave 3, the first two waves of data were not included in this study. The analytic sample included participants with no missing values for any of the predictors and at least two waves of loneliness data. This led to a reduced pool of participants (n = 419), with a total sample size of 1676 data points over the four waves.\\nDifferences between individuals included in the analytic sample (n = 419) and those who were excluded due to missing data (n = 478) were examined for all of the predictors and loneliness outcomes across Waves 3 to 6. There were no significant differences, except for living with a romantic partner at Wave 3 and being employed at the baseline level. Those who remained in the reduced sample were more likely to live with a romantic partner in June 2020, F(1,832) = 8.138, p < . 01 and be employed in January and February 2020, F(1,836) = 13.017, p < . 001, than those who were not in the sample.\\nUnderstanding Society collected responses through web surveys. At each wave, invitation materials were sent out to the main sample, either through email or SMS. Participants used the unique link they received to complete the survey for the month. On average, the questionnaire took 20 minutes to complete. Each respondent received two English pounds upon completion of the survey. Table 1 displays the means, range, and standard deviations of the measures included in the study, with the exception of Gender and Ethnicity. In the analytic sample, 29.4% were male, and 70.6% were female. The ethnic composition of the analytic sample was: 77.8% White, 4.3% mixed, 15.0% Asian or Asian British, 2.6% Black or Black British, and 0.2% from other ethnic groups.\\nGender was a dichotomous variable, coded as 1 = Male; 0 = Female. Ethnicity was coded into five groups: White, Asian, Mixed, Black, and Other.\\nSelf-Reported Loneliness was measured in Waves 3 to 6 with a single item: \"How often do you feel lonely?\" (Office for National Statistics, 2018). Responses included \"Hardly ever or never\", \"Some of the time\", and \"Often\".\\nSelf-Reported Emotional Support was based on a single question in Wave 3: \"How much emotional support are friends and family who do not live with you providing these days when compared to January and February 2020?\" (1 = Less; 2 = About the same; 3 = More).\\nLiving with a Romantic Partner was a derived measure in Wave 3, filtering if any of the household members was the respondent\\'s husband/wife/civil partner/partner/cohabitee (1 = Yes; 0 = No).\\nHousehold Income per year was categorised into a range with equal intervals of 5000 English pounds. A higher score indicated a higher household income (e.g., 1 = 0 to 5000; 15 = 70001 and greater).\\nEmployment Status was based on the question \"were you in paid work or self-employment at any time in January or February 2020?\" (1 = Yes; 0 = No).\\nEducation Status asked whether the respondent was in school in January and February 2020 (1=Yes; 0=No).\\nBaseline Physical Health Condition was a count of 20 items asking whether the respondent had long-standing physical health conditions in the past 12 months including asthma, cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, stroke, or other conditions. Baseline Mental Health Condition was a single item asking Note: SD = standard deviation; N/A = not applicable.\\nwhether the respondent has emotional, nervous, or psychiatric problems (1 = Yes; 0 = No).\\nUsing SPSS, growth curve modelling was employed to examine the trajectory of loneliness from June to November 2020. The use of growth curve modelling is advantageous as it does not require equal spacing between time points and accounts for missing outcome data. To assess the trajectory of loneliness, time was coded to reflect the number of months from Wave 3, where Wave 3 = 0, Wave 4 = 1, Wave 5 = 3, Wave 6 = 5. A level 1 model examined within-individual change in loneliness, assessing the linear slope (i.e., average rate of change) and quadratic slope (i.e., degree of curvature averaged across the sample). A level 2 model then incorporated significant covariates and interactions, examining the associations between gender and emotional support at the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope. Models were examined using maximum likelihood estimation to account for missing data. Due to the restriction in the degrees of freedom, the residual variance component of the quadratic slope was not included in the models. Table 2 presents the final growth curve model, with coefficient estimates of the intercept and slopes accounting for the self-reported loneliness trajectory from June to November 2020. As shown in Fig. 2 , on average, those aged 18 to 25 experienced a decrease in self-reported loneliness from June through July and then an increase from September to November 2020. The positive quadratic trend for time was highly significant, indicating a U-shape trajectory of self-reported loneliness over time (see Table 2 ).\\nSeveral covariates revealed significant main effects at the intercept only. Being employed, being in school, as well as having a higher annual household income were all associated with lower levels of self-reported loneliness. Pre-existing physical and mental health conditions were associated with higher levels of self-reported loneliness.\\nA significant interaction between gender and self-reported emotional support was found at the intercept only. As Fig. 3 demonstrates, males who reported receiving a higher level of emotional support also reported lower levels of loneliness compared to males who reported receiving a lower level of emotional support. Females, however, reported similar levels of loneliness regardless of the amount of emotional support they reported.\\nDrawing upon the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey, we investigated how self-reported loneliness changed as a function of time and its association with emotional support as well as demographic and health factors. A U-shape longitudinal trend was observed in selfreported loneliness from June to November 2020, with a sharp rise during the winter months under the national lockdown. Findings suggest that young adults with long-standing physical or mental health conditions were more likely to report feeling lonely. Lower household income and not having a job or not in school at baseline were also significant predictors of self-reported loneliness. Furthermore, gender was found to moderate the association between self-reported emotional support and loneliness. While greater emotional support was associated with less loneliness in males, no association was shown for females.\\nThe U-shaped self-reported loneliness trajectory from June to November 2020 might point to two main directions. First, this might imply that there is a seasonal variation in loneliness. As earlier research has addressed, loneliness peaks during the winter months among older adults (Victor et al., 2015) . While less research has focused on the 18-25 age group, young adults can also suffer from lack of companionship during the winter months. Indeed, after hitting the lowest in July, the mean loneliness level rose again towards November. However, as the current analysis only covered June to November, this seasonal variation explanation needs further examination. Second, the trajectory of self-reported loneliness might correspond to the extent to which social activities were limited due to the lockdown policies. Looking at the policy changes during this period (see Fig. 1 ), it seems plausible that the further easing of social distancing policies from June to July mapped onto the reduced loneliness from Wave 3 to Wave 4. During the two-month interval between July and September, the new \\'rule of 6\\' was introduced. This was also when an increase in loneliness was reported in the Wave 5 data, toward the end of September. Finally, the introduction of 3-tier local alert levels system and the start of the second national lockdown seem to correspond to the further rise in selfreported loneliness in November, exceeding the initial level observed in June. This explanation is in line with previous research highlighting the importance of social connection in predicting levels of loneliness for this age group (Qualter et al., 2015) .\\nRegarding demographic factors, the present study yielded findings in accordance with past COVID-19 research (Bu et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) . Socio-economic characteristics had a significant association with how often one feels lonely. In addition, being employed and being in school at the beginning of 2020 were associated with a lower risk of reporting feeling lonely during the pandemic. This is consistent with the theory of emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2014) , where work and education status might potentially be signs of age-specific personal achievements among the 18-25 age group (Luhmann and Hawkley, 2016) . School and work may also benefit the young adult due to the more extensive social network it can provide, reducing social disconnection (Qualter et al., 2015) .\\nMeanwhile, young adults with a pre-existing mental health problem or one or more long-standing physical health conditions reported higher loneliness levels during this unusual period, coinciding with previous research (McGlone and Long, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) . The current findings reaffirm the heightened risks brought by these long-term conditions, calling attention to tailoring interventions for vulnerable young adults.\\nIn the present study, gender was found to moderate the association between self-reported emotional support and loneliness. This finding was unexpected as females have reported feeling lonelier than males in the UK since the start of 2020 (Bu et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2020; O\\'Connor et al., 2020) . With a heightened focus on social relationships, (Lee and Goldstein, 2016) . Consequently, young females may require more emotional support to buffer feelings of loneliness compared to males. The meaning of emotional support could also be interpreted differently by male and female respondents. It has been argued that females are more willing to express emotions, which may lead to an unavoidable potential bias across self-reported data (Tamres et al.,2002) . This may reflect the differential impact of self-reported emotional support on their self-reported loneliness.\\nSeveral limitations need to be noted when interpreting the findings. First, the study is correlational. For this reason, no firm conclusions can be made about the factors that predict loneliness in young adults. Second, there could be sampling biases. For example, having access to the internet was a fundamental requirement to complete the web surveys from Understanding Society. Third, some measures were limited due to the constraint on the questionnaires. For example, the survey included one-item measures of loneliness and emotional support. These selfreported measures may not have the complexity to capture a more nuanced picture of either construct. Furthermore, the survey only asked about the amount of emotional support received from individuals outside the household, disregarding support from household members as well as the quality of support received. Fourth, a quantifiable measure of emotional support was not gathered at Waves 1 and 2 and subsequent waves after Wave 3. Thus, it was not possible to investigate how emotional support predicts the trajectory of loneliness from Wave 1 and whether changes in emotional support over time predict changes in the trajectory of loneliness among UK young adults.\\nThis study charts the trajectory of loneliness among UK young adults during the summer to winter months of the pandemic in 2020. The trajectory closely follows the restrictions of the lockdown, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on the loneliness of young adults. The findings identify population sub-groups at risk of loneliness, such as those with long-standing physical or mental health conditions and those with a lower household income, as well as vulnerable time periods relating to increased lockdown restrictions and winter months. The findings further highlight the importance of targeted interventions which consider diverse social needs, including young adults who are not The present study also adds to our knowledge of the impact of emotional support on loneliness and possible gender differences in the strength of this association. The findings seem to suggest that the quantity of emotional support from friends and family outside of the household may not benefit females\\' feelings of loneliness. To further our understanding, it would be beneficial to study variations in the social and emotional connectedness patterns of young adults, both in terms of quality and quantity, and their effectiveness in easing loneliness across population groups.\\nYanran Hu: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing -original draft, Project administration.

The four sub-groups in the Fig. are male with high emotional support (HE Male); male with low emotional support (LE Male); female with high emotional support (HE Female); and female with low emotional support (LE Female). In which, higher emotional support indicated one SD increase in mean emotional support, whereas lower emotional support indicated one SD decrease in mean emotional support.', 'The global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has accelerated the rapid change of the health care-social media landscape. Over 3.6 billion people worldwide use social media (1), making it a natural home for both health information and misinformation to circulate widely and rapidly. As our understanding of COVID-19 evolved, social media served as a valuable tool for amplifying the latest developments. As recommendations changed frequently, clinicians, scientists, and organizations took to social media to broadcast their views. However, early data were frequently incomplete, inaccurate, and later revised or rejected (2, 3) .\\nWithin the field of pulmonary and critical care medicine, some clinicians rapidly became regarded as experts in this novel coronavirus-some recognized as such by the wider community, while others were self-appointed. Throughout the world, as clinicians battled COVID-19, uncontrolled observations of patients\\' physiology or ventilator management strategies quickly became lore and were rapidly disseminated on Twitter before the rigors of peer review had set in. Moreover, because the time-cycle of social media is so brief, even experts whose \"hot takes\" had quickly gone viral rarely returned to their prior content with corrections, thus unintentionally perpetuating inaccurate information. As responsible stewards of science communication, trainees need to be familiar with best practices to safely and appropriately navigate social media, both in consuming content and posting their own.\\nThe fast pace of clinical observations and publication has irrevocably changed clinical training and medical education. Because trainees are deeply embedded in the trenches of daily patient care and are comfortable with social media platforms, having grown up with them, they have an incredibly valuable perspective to contribute to digital conversations.\\nBecause trainees have grown up as \"digital natives\" who view social media as an important and intrinsic part of society (4), one might assume that trainees are comfortable engaging with social media in a dynamic clinical context. However, students, residents, and fellows may feel reticent, or even discouraged, about sharing their views, especially if they are sharing ideas on areas outside of their expertise or because of feelings of \"impostor syndrome\" (5) . In addition to worries about \"impostor syndrome,\" some may also feel pressure to \"go viral\" by accruing likes or followers by making bold or even inflammatory statements in posts. Contributing authentically to the digital conversation, without falling for the common social media \"traps,\" can be challenging.\\nLike all social media users, trainees should be very careful about biases and blind spots. The Dunning-Kruger effect (6) is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their own knowledge or ability in a specific area. There is not always a linear correlation between confidence and competence, and learners may have blind spots of their own knowledge gaps. This effect can be magnified on social media, where a lack of knowledge combined with a strongly expressed opinion can be a recipe for a bad tweet going viral. This applies to all social media users and is not limited to trainees. For example, Tesla CEO Elon Musk\\'s tweet that \"ICUs [intensive care units] were jumping the gun on intubation and setting PEEP [positive end-expiratory pressure] and O 2 too high\" (7) was rightfully criticized by the medical community (8) .\\nTrainees who might be reluctant to engage in social media should recognize that, as some of the most \"viral\" yet inaccurate expert opinions have demonstrated, experience does not always mean that experts\\' words should be believed uncritically. In fact, research shows that novices often have more competence and skill than they perceive (9) .\\nWe believe that trainee voices are unique, valid, and important and that instead of being reluctant to engage in social media around medical topics, trainees actually have unique expertise that can inform debates. This Perspective describes best practices for trainees to appropriately and effectively navigate social media while gaining the confidence to make their voices heard.\\nTRAINEE ENGAGEMENT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA: A MODIFIED \"BLOOM\\'S TAXONOMY\" PYRAMID \"Bloom\\'s Taxonomy\" is a well-known framework in the medical education literature describing educational objectives and how to link these objectives to assessment (10) . Lower levels on the pyramid represent objectives such as merely knowing a fact, whereas higher level objectives ask learners to apply their knowledge or perform a simulated task. Bloom\\'s Taxonomy is a helpful framework with which many medical educators are familiar, and a modified Bloom\\'s Taxonomy depicting how trainees can constructively engage with social media has been proposed (11) .\\nIn addition to using this modified Bloom\\'s Taxonomy, we recognize the critical role that persuasion plays in social media discourse of the medical community. Therefore, we propose that to persuasively and effectively communicate on social media, one should integrate Aristotle\\'s lessons of rhetoric to science communication (12) : the use of ethos, logos, pathos, and the lesser-known kairos. Ethos refers to appealing to ethics, that is, conveying to the readership that the author has credibility and expertise. It can be helpful to frame arguments by indicating how you have expertise in this area. Logos refers to appealing to logic, that is, conveying to the readership that the argument is rooted in logic, science, and structure. Systematically and deliberately laying out a case in your social media appeal, and backing it up with pertinent citations, is critical. Pathos refers to the appeal to the reader\\'s passions. Though clinicians are often reluctant to share their emotions about clinical situations, pathos is useful in making an effective argument. We will outline ways to do so without compromising patient confidentiality. Lastly, the lesser-known kairos refers to the appeal of timeliness and knowing the opportune time to bring forward a persuasive social media discussion.\\nThese two frameworks may be used systematically to explore the different stages of social media engagement to provide guidance for trainees navigating the social media landscape safely and appropriately ( Figure 1 ).\\nNovice users begin to get involved in social media by reading what others are posting. However, consumers of social media need to be aware of biases and misinformation. The most popular \"viral\" posts may not have the most balanced or accurate information (13) . Trainees must be cautious, even while consuming content on social media. Consider the ethos, the source, or author of the content: Who has written the article? What are their credentials and experiences that lend them expertise in this area? What are their possible biases? What explicit agenda or hidden curriculum could they be promoting? Do they have any conflicts of interest, either disclosed or undisclosed? Can this information be corroborated elsewhere, or is it just one voice? Is the information presented as fact or opinion? Even when prominent authoritative voices in the field post medical information, these factors should be considered.\\nTrainees often use social media to promote, celebrate, and disseminate their own scholarly work or that of their peers (14) . Similarly, trainees may amplify posts with which they agree. When promoting social media content, the same considerations should be applied: just as when consuming content, trainees should be wary of misinformation and disinformation and consider authorship, expertise, biases, and blind spots. Trainees should apply a critical eye to ensure that arguments that they are amplifying are rooted in evidence (logos) and not merely amplifying experts for the sake of being considered as \"experts.\"\\nWhen posting on social media, trainees should consider who they represent, that is, does this viewpoint represent the trainee, their institution/program, or even their profession? Though many individuals use disclaimers such as \"Tweets my own\" to indicate that they are speaking only for themselves and not their institution, inflammatory posts can lead to significant implications beyond the individual.\\nTrainees should consider diversity-or lack thereof-of voices being amplified. When not thoughtfully curated, social media feeds can sometimes become an \"echo chamber\" of voices that lack diversity of thought, sex, race/ethnicity, and ability (15) . Websites that provide sex breakdowns of social media followers (16) are accessible, and opting to see the latest tweets rather than those chosen by an algorithm can help improve the diversity of voices in your timeline.\\nAn exciting aspect of social media and medical Twitter is the real-time vigorous debate of ideas, physiologic principles, new clinical trials, and other important research papers. The \"court of social media\" has become an important platform for discussion in the modern era of publishing, in which it is common for authors to share their preprints on online servers before the journal peer-review process is complete. Though this can lead to prompt vetting of medical misinformation, unfortunately, it can also lead to erroneous dissemination of information before the facts are clear. Because science is an iterative process, when discussing new science on social media, be willing to revise opinions and recommendations as new data emerges. When discussing evolving recommendations, it is particularly helpful to share links to the original research whenever possible and explain the reasoning as to why recommendations have changed. Though posting screenshots of \"old takes\" sharing misinformation seems to be a popular \"gotcha\" mechanism, we caution against this because science is a process in which information changes rapidly, and clinicians need to communicate this respectfully, rapidly, and in a trustworthy fashion. For example, criticizing early anecdotes on how acute respiratory distress syndrome owing to COVID-19 is different from other causes or posting links several months later to old social media warnings early in the pandemic asking people to save masks for healthcare workers, is not helpful in moving the medical conversation forward.\\nFinally, trainees should remember the \"New York Times\" rule of ethical conduct, which, when applied to social media, argues that when posting content in a professional capacity, do not post something that you would not want to be reported on the front page of a newspaper. In general, this refers to content that might be perceived as unprofessional, such as comments about patients or families or comments about other specialties. However, this sentiment should not dissuade trainees from using their voices to advocate for issues important to them in an informed and evidence-based way. For example, healthcare providers can persuasively advocate for candidates for political office or policies that improve health care for patients.\\nPutting it All Together: Ethos, Logos, Pathos, and Kairos to Create Social Media Content\\nWhen creating your own content, consider appealing to all aspects of Aristotle\\'s principles of rhetoric, including considering the author, the audience, the emotion, the argument, and the timeliness of the argument. Arguments should be clear and persuasive, and anecdotes paired with data can often be particularly effective. Posts with images and links to primary literature sometimes linked in threads are best practices for sharing information (17) . Trainees should also consider their own unique perspectives reflected by their own experiences and expertise, as well as their own biases and blind spots, when creating social media content.\\nPosts about patients should always be avoided, and care should be taken to avoid any identifying information in social media posts and to consider the broader implications of a post. Healthcare social media experts such as Dr. A. O. Glasser have noted to \"post the pearl, not the patient\" to disseminate teaching points while avoiding identifying patients inadvertently (18). Even posts expressing pride or joy about a new invasive procedure performed (e.g., \"Used a Bougie like a pro today!\") can come across as insensitive to patients and families and may also run afoul of privacy and ethics rules, as dates can cause the information to be identifiable and traced. Patients and family members follow physicians on social media, so one must balance the timeliness of a post with patient privacy considerations. One practical way to do this is to wait for a few weeks before posting anonymized anecdotes or \"pearls.\" For example, posting a \"pearl\" about endocarditis may seem innocent enough, but for the patient\\'s family member who recognizes the physician as part of the care team, it can feel like an invasion of privacy. To counteract this, it makes sense to wait a few weeks before posting anything remotely identifiable and traceable to a specific patient. When posting sensitive information about one\\'s institutional policies or leadership, be sensitive to the impact of your tweet on your institution. Finally, if social media discussions become contentious, an important tip is to avoid responding to inflammatory posts or continuing to engage in unproductive conversations. Table 1 provides a summary with examples of tips and traps to review these principles. Although this list is not comprehensive, the advice is based on our personal experiences navigating social media, and way. At the same time, we acknowledge our bias as faculty at academic medical centers and appreciate that these general tips do not address particular challenges that women and underrepresented-in-medicine trainees may face when engaging in social media (19) .\\nNavigating the fast-paced world of social media need not be treacherous, though trainees should tread carefully to consume, promote, discuss, and create social media content. By remembering Aristotle\\'s original concepts of rhetoric and persuasion, trainees can thoughtfully and effectively engage in social media by considering the source of information, constructing logical arguments, appealing to emotion, and keeping discussion timely and relevant. We hope that this Perspective demystifies the process and shows trainees that engaging in social media, even in the time of coronavirus, can be educational, impactful, and even joyful. ', \"In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 23 identified in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China (1). The disease caused by this highly 24 contagious viral pathogen, which was later named as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 25 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), spread rapidly to other countries, 26 including Iran, South Korea, and Italy. As of May 13, 2020, 188 countries have reported 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 293,241 deaths having occurred worldwide (2).\\nPatients infected with this novel betacoronavirus mostly manifest with fever, cough, dyspnea, 29 headache and fatigue (3, 4) . In a minority of patients, SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia can 30 lead to severe complications such as, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure 31 and even death (3-6).\\nAccording to literature, patients with COVID-19 are prone to developing lymphopenia, increased 33 neutrophil count and thrombocytopenia (4, 7, 8) . More recently, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 34 (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were proposed as potential predictors of mortality 35 in confirmed cases of . Higher levels of infection-related markers, including C-36 reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, serum ferritin, and 37 proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL1B, IFNγ, TNFα) have also been suggested as markers of 38 disease progression in several studies (12) (13) (14) . 39 The vast majority of studies describing the demographics and clinical characteristics, as well as computed tomography (CT) findings, were included in this study. Demographic data including 54 age, sex, date of admission, and laboratory findings were collected from patients' electronic 55 medical records. One researcher reviewed the data collection forms for quality control. No age 56 limitation was considered in our study; however, approximately all included patients were adults.\\nFinal follow-up date was May 1, 2020. Patients were divided into three main groups: patients 58 who were admitted to the ward, patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 59 those who died until follow-up. It should be noted that patients who had died by the end of final 60 follow-up but had also received care in the ICU/ward during hospitalization were included in the 61 'expired' group, and all the patients in the 'ward' and 'ICU' groups had survived until final 62 follow-up date. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shahid Beheshti University respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was conducted to assess the distribution normality.\\nTo compare the continuous variables between the groups, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis 84 tests were used for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively. Chi-square test was used 85 for comparing categorical data between groups. Subgroup analysis was also performed for 86 patients who had a positive RT-PCR test. Pearson's correlation test was used for assessing the 87 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f correlation between mortality and variables. Patients were divided into two categories for this 88 analysis; those who were admitted to the ICU or ward were grouped as survivors and those 89 patients who died during the study period formed the non-survivors group. All statistical 90 analyses were performed with SPSS software version 23.0 (IBM corp., Chicago, IL, USA). P-91 values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Three age groups were defined: 92 patients less than 21 years old, patients aged 21-64 years, and those older than or equal to 65 93 years.\\nTotal study population 96 A total of 1061 hospitalized patients were included in this study. Among these, 129 (12.2%) 97 patients died at some point during hospitalization in the ward or intensive care unit (ICU). From 98 the remaining 932 survivors, 46 (5.0%) patients were admitted to the ICU and 886 (95.0%) 99 patients were hospitalized in the ward. The median age of all patients was 55 (44-66) years, and 100 65.2% of the cases were males. Also, the median age of those who died was 65 years and no 101 significant difference in age was seen between patients who died and those who received ICU 102 care (p=0.064); however, patients who died were significantly older than those hospitalized in 103 the ward (p<0.001). Although all patients were considered as COVID-19 positive cases, only 104 53.6% had a positive RT-PCR test. The laboratory findings of patients within each group are 105 demonstrated in Table 1 . As shown, 126 (12.3%) patients had leukopenia and 708 (66.7%) had 106 lymphopenia at baseline. The median absolute number of lymphocytes was 1.2 × 10 3 per 107 microliter (IQR, 0.9-1.6 × 10 3 per microliter). Among laboratory tests, only hemoglobin level, performing a subgroup analysis, we found that results were similar to that of the total population 131 except for ALT and serum ferritin, which did not vary significantly between the three groups 132 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (p=0.307 and p=0.135, respectively), and PTT, which was found to be statistically different 133 across groups (p=0.047) ( Table 2) .\\nCorrelation between mortality and study variables 135 As shown in Table 3 (Table 3) . follow-up date but had received ICU care prior to death were not included in the 'ICU' group.\\nMany studies have investigated laboratory findings in COVID-19 that are associated with disease 168 severity. Generally, patients with COVID-19 tend to have abnormal blood counts, coagulopathy, 169 and liver and kidney dysfunction (4, 8). Higher serum CRP, D-dimer, LDH, creatine kinase and 170 procalcitonin levels have been found among patients with severe disease (17, 18, 23, 24) . In this 171 study, D-dimer, serum ferritin and albumin had the strongest correlation with mortality.\\nAlthough albumin has a half-life of 15 to 19 days, it is more rapidly decreased than expected 173 during the course of COVID-19 infection. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, 174 particularly IL-6, increase vascular permeability during an acute-phase response and result in the 175 redistribution of albumin into the interstitial space (25). In addition, increased IL-6 may induce 176 apoptosis in lymphocytes, leading to lymphopenia in patients with . Of note, our 177 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study failed to show a significant difference in IL-6 levels between the three groups; however, in 178 contrast to patients admitted to the ward or ICU, the median IL-6 level (10.1 pg/ml) was higher 179 than the upper limit of normal (5.9 pg/ml) in patients who died. Another finding of this study 180 was that patients who died had significantly increased ESR and serum ferritin levels and a higher 181 proportion of positive CRP compared with those admitted to the ward. These results suggest that 182 patients with severe disease have an increased activity of the innate immune system. As \\nAmong all patients, approximately 67% had lymphopenia; this is in accordance with previous 203 reports that have indicated a diagnostic value for lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19 on 204 admission (12, 17, 28, 33, 34) . According to our results, patients who died were more likely to 205 have WBC count of more than 10.0 × 10 3 per microliter compared with patients who received 206 care in the ward. In a single-center study by Qu and colleagues, a higher PLR was proposed as a 207 prognostic indicator of prolonged hospitalization in confirmed cases of COVID-19. They also 208 found that patients with a peak in the absolute count of platelets during the disease course had 209 poor outcomes (11). Likewise, in our study, PLR values were markedly lower in the ward 210 patients compared with those who died. Interestingly, only lymphocyte percentages were 211 significantly lower in patients admitted to the ICU compared with those hospitalized in the ward. In this study, we included 1061 patients who were treated as COVID-19 patients; however, 223 nearly half of these patients had a positive RT-PCR test while the remaining patients tested 224 negative. Since the current gold standard test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is RT-PCR, we 225 performed a subgroup analysis among patients with laboratory-confirmed Notwithstanding, the results were relatively similar to those of the total population.\\nOur study has several limitations. First, we did not report the detailed clinical and radiologic 228 manifestations of the included population due to lack of access to data. Thus, we were not able to 229 evaluate the severity of disease based on predefined classifications by international agencies.\\nSecond, we did not consider the comorbidities of patients, a factor that may have an important 231 role in the mortality of patients with COVID-19 (6). In addition, due to the retrospective nature 232 of the study, we did not have access to complete lab data for all patients, which might potentially 233 reduce the strength of the reported findings.\\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that laboratory abnormalities are seen in patients \", 'On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest. After the December 2019 outbreak in China, the novel Coronavirus infection, designated SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), spread very quickly worldwide. By April, 2020, a total of 104,291 laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented in Italy. Large-scale testing finds and isolates infections quickly, limiting the virus\\'s spread and protecting vulnerable populations. To properly survey populations, millions of Covid-19 test kits will need to be processed. Organizations around the world are trying to ramp up their capacity as quickly as possible. Local, national, and international media continuously attack regional and national institutions, complaining about the inability of the Lombardy Region, the most solid and advanced Italian region in terms of public health, for not having the possibility to process a capillary population-based swab screening test. Covid-19 causes a clinical syndrome encompassing a wide range of clinical features, from an asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic course to acute respiratory distress and death (1, 2) . In a very recent publication in Gut, Lin et al. showed that around 11% of patients infected with Covid-19 presented with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (1), i.e. diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain, or described having them at disease onset or even before respiratory symptoms. Following this evidence, our work published in Gut clearly remarked the importance of including GI symptoms in the spectrum of Covid-19 features (3). In a very recent work, we preliminarily observed that several laboratory tests have been shown as characteristically altered in Covid-19. In our paper,\\nbaseline biochemical parameters were clearly linked to clinical features. Our hematological exams at admission showed low white blood cell counts (WBC count) and low neutrophil counts in over 80% of cases and lymphocyte counts below 1x109/L at least half of the patients. Also C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels were elevated in most patients, particularly among those with the worst clinical picture and outcome (Benelli G et al., SARS-COV-2 comorbidity network and outcome in hospitalized patients in Crema, Italy. https://doiorg/101101/2020041420053090 2020). In our opinion paper published in the Archive of Medical Research, we proposed a few laboratory tests as rapid and sensitive alternatives for identifying likely Covid-19 cases (4) . The Corona Score model was recently proposed as an easy-to-use algorithm for identifying Covid-19 patients with respiratory symptoms (5) . This approach uses a chest images-relative score (1 to 4) and several laboratory parameters to classify emergency room patients. This algorithm is recommended for use only with patients with respiratory symptoms and fails in patients with negative chest imaging, as occurs in some Covid-19 patients with GI onset (5). In the light of these observations, we decided to choose an \"alternative\" approach to identifying likely Covid-19 patients with GI onset. We have created and propose a new scoring system, called the Modified Corona Score, (MCorona score), using age, gender, and laboratory parameters, as shown in table 1, without including chest images as part of the score that now ranges between 0 and 10. We retrospectively analyzed 400 confirmed Covid-19 patients (with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction) admitted to the General Hospital of Crema between February 21 and March 13, 2020. Among them, 42 (10.5%) reported GI symptoms including nausea vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Absence of cough was reported in 83% of patients with GI symptoms and 16.6% (7 patients) with negative chest imaging. We applied our score to a patients cohort and calculated the score range and mean value. The MCorona score in our patients cohort ranged between 6 and 10, with the mean score being 7. The same evidence was reported in 42 patients with GI symptoms (6-10, mean = 7). Using preliminary score cut-offs of 4, we applied this evidence to patients without respiratory onset. All six patients presented a mean range of 7, the same as other patients. The preliminary score accuracy appeared satisfactory, increasing the detection rate of patients with GI onset and negative chest images (42/42, 100%). Our study offers a new and rapid tool for identifying patients with gastrointestinal onset of Covid-19. This scoring method could be used to accelerate determination of isolation needs and optimize the predictive outcome of CT scans. However, more caution and a larger sample size are needed in order to verify the accuracy and specificity of the score. In conclusion, we propose the completely validated MCorona score method for assessing Covid-19 patients with GI features. The preliminary data regarding this scoring system is very encouraging, but further studies are needed. MCorona score could open a new road to successfully identifying all likely Covid-19 patients with symptoms other than respiratory distress. ', 'To respond effectively to the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it is essential to understand the molecular basis for a successful immune response to coronavirus infection (Iwasaki and Yang (2020) ). In particular, characterising the B-cell response is important as the identification of potent neutralising antibodies could pave the way for effective treatments, aid in prior exposure diagnosis, or assist in predicting vaccine efficacy (e.g. Tay et al. (2020) ; Liao et al. (2020) ; Wen et al. (2020) ; Zhao et al. (2020); Nielsen et al. (2020) ; Galson et al. (2020) ). Such molecular characterisations of binding/neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are now beginning to emerge.\\nEarly studies have shown a large proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralising response is SARS-CoV-2 specific, although some SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV-1 (the virus responsible for the 2003 epidemic) crossneutralising antibodies do exist (Pinto et al. (2020) ; Yuan et al. (2020) ; Robbiani et al. (2020) ). This is possible because many of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein domains, including the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), share high sequence and structural similarity (Tay et al. (2020) ). Other SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins also display high sequence similarity to more distantly related betacoronaviruses, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Therefore, molecular knowledge of any antibody able to bind a betacoronavirus antigen could be relevant in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nIn addition to the large existing body of work studying SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the number of investigations into SARS-CoV-2 is extremely high. As an indication, 1,134 SARS-CoV-2 preprints were uploaded to BioRxiv and MedRxiv between January-March 2020, while 3,462 were uploaded in April and May. We have therefore built CoV-AbDab, a database that documents molecular information (i.e. sequence and structure) and metadata on all preprinted, published, and patented anti-coronavirus antibodies. It will save valuable time in the fight against COVID-19 and act as a central hub to consolidate knowledge and coordinate efforts to identify novel antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2. Researchers can use CoV-AbDab to yield new insights, including deriving crucial sequence/structural patterns that distinguish neutralising from nonneutralising SARS-CoV-2 binders (Iwasaki and Yang (2020) ), or deducing independent neutralising epitopes exploitable by combination therapies (Hansen et al. (2020) ).\\nAcademic papers and patents containing coronavirus-binding antibodies were sourced by querying PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, GenBank, and Google Patents with relevant search terms. A full list of references is given in the database and in the Supporting Information. ANARCI (Dunbar and Deane (2016) ) was used to number amino acid sequences in the IMGT (Lefranc et al. (2003) ) numbering scheme, and to assign V and J gene origins. Our Structural Antibody Database (Dunbar et al. (2013) ), which tracks all antibody structures submitted to the Protein Data Bank (PDB, Berman et al. (2000) ), was mined to identify relevant solved structures. Our antibody/nanobody homology modelling tool, ABodyBuilder (Leem et al. (2016) ), was used to generate full Fv region structural models.\\nAs of 5 th August 2020, CoV-AbDab contains 1402 entries from 66 publications and 21 patents. Of these entries, 147 bind to MERS-CoV, 483 bind to SARS-CoV-1, and 1131 bind to SARS-CoV-2 (each entry may be tested against multiple coronaviruses). All entries contain a minimum of germline information, the CDR3 sequence, or Material Transfer Agreement contact information (a complete list of metadata is provided in the Supporting Information). Currently, 1303/1402 entries (92.9%) contain full variable domain antibody (Fv) or nanobody (VHH) sequences.\\nA comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV binder biological/synthetic origins (Fig. S1 ), binder targets (Fig. S2) , and human antibody binder heavy V-gene germlines (Fig. S3) is available in the Supporting Information. The origin plots show how technological advances have impacted the nature of isolated binders and this should be considered when comparing binders to different coronaviruses.\\nWe are reaching out to authors of new studies characterising coronavirus binding antibodies to send us their data in Excel or CSV format (opig@stats.ox.ac.uk). We require a minimum of the antibody/nanobody clonotype (closest heavy and light V and J gene transcripts plus the CDR3 amino acid sequences) but ideally seek the full antibody variable domain [Fv] or full nanobody [VHH] sequence. We also require binding data against at least one specified coronavirus protein reported in a preprint, publication, or patent. Through these submissions and our own efforts to track the scientific literature, we hope to provide a central community resource for coronavirus antibody sequence and structural information.\\nCoV-AbDab is located at http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/coronavirus (Fig. S4A) . Users can download the entire database or search-filtered results as a CSV file and bulk download all ANARCI numberings, IMGT-numbered antibody-or nanobody-CoV structure files, and IMGTnumbered antibody/nanobody homology models (Fig. S4B) . A summary of tracked (but not included) antibodies and coronavirus studies is also provided.\\nThe database can be queried by variable domain sequence (Fig.  S4C ) or by attribute (Fig. S4D) . Attribute search results can be further filtered by a search term and ordered by any metadata field for maximum interpretability (Fig. S4E) . Searching by sequence returns the top-10 same-length whole chain and/or CDR3 sequence identities to the query. Query-target alignments are displayed (Fig. S4F) . Any entry with a homology model can be viewed in-browser using our native molecular viewer (Fig. S4G) .', 'How does body posture influence the way we interpret and perceive the external environment? Our constant physical interaction with the world requires a continuous update of the body\\'s location in external space, its relation to other objects, and its relation to itself (e.g., the relative positions of body-parts in motion). These varied representations of the body form a conscious perception of the external world and play an essential role in action planning. Think for instance of driving a car with a stirring wheel in your hand -sensory information about the wheel gives rise to a coherent perception of its function and leads to a set of possible actions that one can perform with it. First, we access the wheel\\'s physical dimensions through tactile stimulations received on our palms that form an anatomical reference frame. To steer the car, we transfer this information into a different reference frame that integrates the anatomical reference frame with external information fitting the wheel\\'s functional use (e.g. the sidewalk is to right, the opposite lane is to left), in a process known as tactile remapping 1, 2 . The transformation results in the adoption of an allocentric reference frame that is independent of the body, relating objects\\' dimensions to external anchors, or of an egocentric reference frame, relating objects\\' positions to one\\'s own body 3, 4 . Tactile stimulations can be remapped into many allocentric or egocentric reference frames with the ultimate selection depending on the actions that precede or follows the sensation 5, 6 , the gravitational dimensions of the external environment [7] [8] [9] [10] , and the general position of the body 2,4,11 .\\nWhich cognitive mechanisms drive tactile remapping? One influential view considers tactile remapping as part of a wider process of acquiring sensorimotor contingencies 2,8,12,13 . According to this theory, perception emerges through experiencing multiple co-patterns of incoming sensory signals coupled with outgoing motor actions towards the stimulus. In the context of tactile remapping, multiple reference frames are learned from exposure to tactile stimulations that are integrated with visual and proprioceptive cues to execute diverse actions.\\nThereafter, many reference frames are accessible with different probability weights that are constantly updated with ongoing sensorimotor experiences, and are then retrieved implicitly during the tactile remapping process 2, 3, 13 . Supporting studies show that a change to body posture, gaze, or object\\'s position in external space triggers a gradual adaptation period marked by inconsistent reference frame selections and increases in decision times as participants integrate new sensory information 4, 10, 14, 15 . Over time, participants\\' reference frames selection becomes more robust as new contingencies are established 2,10,16,17 .\\nHowever, the description of tactile remapping as a byproduct of sensorimotor contingencies overlooks the differential contribution of vision and proprioception to the process. In particular, it is known that vision is our predominant sensory modality for spatial processing and has a particularly strong influence on reference frame selections. Vision impairs the localization of tactile stimuli when arms are crossed 17, 18 , determines the assignment of vertical and horizontal axes to our body 14, 19 , and biases actions towards touched objects 20, 21 .\\nConversely, the effects of proprioception (i.e., posture) per se on tactile remapping are less studied and harder to isolate, even when visual inputs are withheld. Such studies typically include complex spatial and cognitive tasks that strongly influence perception but are unrelated to proprioception proper, such as the need to relocate the object after changing postures 2,5,13 , or a manual delivery of tactile stimuli that biases participants\\' responses 4, 14, 15 .\\nIn the current study, we tested the effects of changing body postures on reference frame selection in blindfolded participants. To disentangle the contribution of proprioception from other factors, we built a visual-to-tactile Sensory Substitution Device (SSD) 22,23 that transforms 2D grayscale images into tactile stimuli delivered on the inner arm. The fixed device moves together with the arm and thus nullifies the need to actively relocate the stimulations. With this unique setup, we had participants perform a simple spatial localization/orientation task while also switching their arm\\'s posture between trial blocks. We aimed to further investigate the 4 role of posture in tactile remapping by asking how switching postures affect previously acquired references. According to a strictly sensorimotor prediction, after switching postures new proprioceptive cues will gradually integrate with a stored body representation that will produce an adaptation and learning period, characterized by less consistent responses and longer decision times. Results in this direction will suggest that, albeit vision\\'s dominant influence, incoming proprioceptive signals strongly influence the remapping process. An alternative hypothesis is that proprioception is a unique sensory modality, which we are less consciously aware of 24 , and its effect on remapping is weaker than previously assumed. In this case, participants would rapidly adapt to new postures as top-down representations would override incoming bottom-up proprioceptive cues, diverging from a pure sensorimotor contingency description.\\nIn this study, we investigated the properties of reference frames\\' selection when relying solely on proprioceptive cues. To this aim, we used a visual-to-tactile SSD that transfers 2D images to blindfolded participants\\' arm, which was placed in three different postures (Fig. 1a. ).\\nIn each experimental trial they were presented with a series of vibrotactile stimulations corresponding to pixels an image and their task was to report the stimulus\\' spatial location (\"up/down\") or orientation (\"upward/downward\"). We interpreted their responses on the yaxis based on the anatomy of the inner arm, referred to here as coordinate selection. Distal responses were defined as a perception of the line\\'s upper location/orientation located away from the trunk and towards the wrist. Proximal responses were defined as the perception of the line\\'s upper location/orientation located towards the trunk and the elbow (Fig. 1b.) . This was done to obtain a homogenous categorization of participants\\' responses, ultimately facilitating the identification of their selected reference frame (arm-based, trunk-based, external, etc.).\\nGroup-level analyses were performed with a Wilcoxson signed-rank two-tailed test and corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni, p = 0.05). Subject-level statistics passed the criteria for normal approximation and analyzed with a normalized two-tailed t-test corrected for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate, a = 0.05). \\nIn our second experiment, we replicated parts one and two of experiment 1 while From the fit, we can predict some saturation in the learning process after approximately 60 trials. In contrast to the overall learning curve trend, there is a single significant increase in decision times after the first trial following the first posture switch (n = 20, p = 0.001). \\nTo understand the reference frame choices during the tactile remapping process before and after switching, we analyzed participants\\' responses from both experiments on each part.\\nWe asked whether a participant held one preference over the other compared to chance (Normal approximation to Binominal, X ~ B {n = 16-24, p = q = 0.5}, FDR corrected). All 72 participants showed a clear and significant preference (n = 72, a = 0.05) in part 1 (Fig. 3a. ).\\nFor the Flexion posture all 30 participants took a distal reference frame, while for the Extension posture 27 out of 30 participants adopted the proximal one. In the Neutral posture, six participants showed a consistent proximal preference, and the other six a distal one. In part two, responses from 39 out of 40 participants passed the FDR correction (n = 40, a = 0.05) with a significant consistent preference (Fig. 3a. ). 14 participants who switched from Extension-to-Flexion adopted a distal reference frame (switched coordinates) and 6 adopted a proximal one (maintained the same coordinates). For those who switched from Flexion-to-Extension, 13 adopted a distal reference frame (maintained the same coordinates) and 6 a proximal preference (switched coordinated). In sum, out of the 39 participants, 17 participants changed their reference frame after the switch, which indicates a remapping into external or trunk-centered reference frames, while 22 participants maintained their initial reference frame which indicates a remapping anchored to the anatomy of the inner arm. In part three, all 20 participants\\' responses passed the FDR correction as they all reverted to the preferences selected in part one (Fig. 3a.) . 10 participants adopted a distal reference frame in the Flexion condition. In the Extension condition 8 participants adopted the proximal reference frame and other two the distal one. These individual preferences show that the insignificant group result for the Extension condition in part three (Fig. 2d.) does not stem from participants\\' inability to select and hold a reference frame.\\nTo further investigate the process of changing or maintaining a reference frame, we conducted a post hoc analysis between decision times of participants who changed their reference frame after switching (External or trunk-centered, n = 7) and those who maintained their previous reference frame (arm-centered n = 13). We observed that participants who changed their reference frames have shorter overall decision times (Fig. 3b.) . To examine the differences between the groups we conducted an ANCOVA on the regressions\\' line coefficients. The difference in slopes were not significant between the two groups (df = 1, F = 2.01, p = 0.16) suggesting a similar learning curve for both groups. However, the intercept of participants who maintained their reference frame was significantly higher than those who changed reference frames (n = 72, p = 0.0001).\\nThe current study investigated the role of proprioception in tactile remapping by measuring the effects of arm posture on reference frame selections, and the extent to which they are affected by switching postures. We found that participants\\' initial selection of reference frames is highly dependent on their posture, and was not anchored to a specific anatomical location on the inner arm, such as the wrist or the elbow. The remapping destination was to another body part, such as the trunk or face, which reflected an egocentric reference frame, or otherwise anchored to the external environment in an allocentric reference reference frame that is centered on the trunk or external by reversing their perception of the vertical axis. In contrast to these predictions, the other half adopted a new reference frame that is based on the anatomy of the inner arm, which is invariant to changes in the arm\\'s posture.\\nMost importantly, we observed little cost for either adopting a new or maintaining a reference frame. Participants exhibit a strong consistency in their responses after changing postures while their decision times are unaffected and continue to follow a general learning curve trend (save for the first trial after the switch). Although participants\\' initial reference frame is trunk/facecentered or external, many of our participants switch to a reference frame that is centered on the anatomy of the inner arm. Moreover, our post-hoc analysis hints that participants who chose the inner arm as a reference may sport shorter decision times, even when considering trials that occurred before the switch. The latter result suggests that differences in decision times between the groups couldn\\'t be specifically linked with a posture switch, but perhaps associated with a more general behavior. The small and uneven number of subjects per group and the lack of differences in the learning rate between them calls for a more direct investigation by future studies.\\nConsidering the weighing scheme model of sensorimotor contingencies 2 in the context of our findings, the ability to select multiple reference frames with little cognitive costs follows an extreme instance where all options are weighed equally. It is possible that while the initial choice of reference frames is implicit, switching posture in the absence of vision forces participants to make an explicit choice. This is further corroborated by the results from the second posture switch, where all participants maintained their previous reference frame affirming an explicit choice. Taken together, our results show that top-down modulation can easily nullify low-order proprioceptive cues when choosing between reference frames, and that previously stored representations can be abstracted from current sensory inputs and spatial tasks. We suggest that the lack of visual inputs is the primary reason for the behavior. Vision is essential in forming body representations and has been widely reported as dominant over competing inputs from other modalities 2, 19, 25, 26 . For example, crossing effects in temporal order judgments are substantially decreased when participants are blindfolded but the same manipulation has little effect on the weighing of different reference frames in congenitally blind adults [27] [28] [29] . Moreover, vision and touch share a combined multisensory object representation, which is formed by inputs from both modalities 30 . Visual cues thus act both as facilitators for body representations but also act as a disturbance to maintaining a stored body representation that was tactually derived. As our participants are blindfolded, vison could not override the changes in proprioceptive signals, revealing the contribution of proprioception to the coordinate transformation process. Proprioception is a unique sensory modality, and though much is known about its physiology, it remains a somewhat esoteric sensory modality. While vision is an exteroceptor identified with a known sensation, proprioception is an interoceptor that, for the most part, is not consciously perceived 24 . It is a perception of the self that results from motor actions taken and initiated by the self, and can thus be predicted. As such, the sensory consequences of arm movement could be anticipated, and they might interfere less with higher body representations. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that top-down modulations can nullify new proprioceptive information during the process of tactile remapping, ultimately confirming that the weight of proprioceptive information during spatial tasks is considerably weaker compared to that of visual information. \\nWe conducted two separate experiments of image localization, focusing on the perceived elevation (up-down) coordinate of the presented stimuli. Blindfolded participants were fitted with the device on their dominant hand, and received a short introduction about the device and experimental process, followed by two introductory pre-test stimuli. Importantly, no information was given on the way the algorithm conveys information on the y-axis.\\nParticipants had to report the orientation or spatial position of the stimuli. For horizontal line stimuli (Fig. 1b.) , the question was \"Is the stimulus located on the upper or lower part of the image?\", and for the diagonal line stimuli (Fig. 1b.) , \"Does the stimulus have a downward or upward slope?\". The experimenter did not provide any feedback to participants\\' responses. another block of trials with the same task. To reduce implicit biases, participants were told that switching arm postures is necessary to eliminate fatigue (Fig. 1a. ).\\nIn experiment 2, participants were asked to respond with keyboard strokes as soon as possible, using their non-stimulated hand. To minimize the bias towards the keys\\' physical location, participants were randomly assigned to different key stroke combinations. In part one, 20 participants were randomly assigned to the Extension (n = 10) or Flexion postures (n = 10).\\nParticipants were asked to switch their postures twice (Fig. 1a.) , at the end of part one and of part two. Self-initiated responses resulted in shorter block durations (7:47, CI [7:13, 8:23] minutes) in comparison to the first experiment', \"The implementation of extreme measures of social distancing, including mobility restrictions, banning of mass gatherings, closure of schools and work activities, isolation, and quarantine, helped control the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in China [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Such exceptional coverage and intensive degree of intervention coupled with strict enforcement may be key to the resulting outcome. How this will play out in Europe is still uncertain [9, 10] . Most importantly, how to relax such stringent constraints on social life and economy while controlling the health crisis remains under investigation [11] [12] [13] .\\nHere we use an age-structured mathematical model to (i) assess the current COVID-19 pandemic situation in France, (ii) evaluate the impact of the lockdown implemented nationwide on March 17, 2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is applied to the region of Île-de-France (heavily affected by the epidemic); it is data-driven and calibrated on hospital admission data for the region prior to lockdown.\\nDifferent types and durations of social distancing interventions are explored, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes of individuals (e.g., allowing a larger portion of the population to go to work, while protecting the elderly) and large-scale testing for case finding and isolation. The aim is to identify possible strategies to reduce the public health impact following the lifting of the lockdown.\\nThe original version of this study was made available as a preprint in mid-April, 1 month before the exit from lockdown. This revised version updates the comparison and validation of model projections, once data became available, while maintaining the context of the beginning of lockdown.\\nWe consider a stochastic discrete age-structured epidemic model based on demographic and age profile data [14] of the region of Île-de-France (Fig. 1) . Fig. 1 a Number of hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants per region in France as of April 2, 2020 [15] . b Number of ICU beds in Île-de-France and increase of capacity over time [16] . c Age profile in Île-de-France region corresponding to younger children, teenagers, adults, seniors (0, 11; 11, 19; 19, 65 ; and 65+ years old, respectively). d Contact matrices in the baseline scenario (no intervention) obtained from data [17] (left) and estimated for lockdown (right)\\nFour age classes are considered: 0-10; 11-18; 19-64 ; and 65+ years old, called in the following younger children (yc), adolescents or teenagers (t), adults (a), and seniors (s), respectively. We use social contact matrices measured in France in 2012 through a social contact survey [17] . The matrices represent the mixing in the baseline scenario (no interventions) between individuals in these four age groups (Fig. 1) , depending on the type of activity and place where the contacts occur (household, school, workplace, transport, leisure, other). Intervention measures are modeled through modifications of the contact matrices (see below).\\nTransmission dynamics follows a compartmental scheme specific for COVID-19 ( Fig. 2) , where individuals are divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, in ICU, recovered, and deceased. The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a prodromic phase (I p ) occurring before the end of the incubation period, followed by a phase where individuals may remain either asymptomatic (I a ) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we distinguish between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic (I ps ), to infectious individuals with mild (I ms ) or severe (I ss ) symptoms, according to data from Italian COVID-19 epidemic [18] and estimates from individual-case data from China and other countries [19] . We explore two values of the probability of being asymptomatic, namely p a = 20% and 50%, in line with available estimates [20] [21] [22] . Individuals in the prodromic phase and asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals have a smaller transmission rate with respect to individuals with moderate or severe symptoms, as reported by contact tracing investigations [23] and estimated in Ref. [8] . Current evidence from household studies, contact tracing investigations, and modeling works suggest that children are as likely to be infected by COVID-19 as adults, but more likely to become either asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic [22, [24] [25] [26] . This may explain the very small percentage (< 5%) of children in COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide [27] . Here we assume that children in both classes (younger children and adolescents) are equally susceptible as adults, following Ref. [24] , and that they become either asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic only. Different relative susceptibility or infectivity of children compared to adults is tested for sensitivity analysis.\\nThe compartmental model includes hospitalization and admission to ICU for severe cases. ICU admission rates, hospital case fatality, and lengths of stay after admission are informed from French hospital data for patient trajectories in Île-de-France region (SIVIC database maintained by the Agence du Numérique en Santé and Santé Publique France [28, 29] ) (see also Additional file 1). ICU beds' occupation is the indicator used to evaluate the capacity of the region to face the surge of patients requiring intensive care. Since we do not use hospital beds' occupation for this evaluation, we neglect the time spent in the hospital after exiting intensive care.\\nParameters, values, and sources used to define the compartmental model are listed in Table S1 of the Additional file 1 [8, 18, 19, 21, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .\\nWe assume that infectious individuals with severe symptoms reduce of 75% their number of contacts because of the illness they experience, as observed during 2009 H1N1 pandemic [36] . Higher reductions are tested as possible interventions of self-isolation (see below).\\nWe implement social distancing interventions by reconstructing the associated changes of the contact matrices, accounting for a reduction of the number of contacts engaged in specific settings. More precisely: Fig. 2 Compartmental model. S, susceptible; E, exposed; I p , infectious in the prodromic phase (the length of time including E and I p stages is the incubation period); I a , asymptomatic infectious; I ps , paucysymptomatic infectious; I ms , symptomatic infectious with mild symptoms; I ss , symptomatic infectious with severe symptoms; ICU, severe case admitted to ICU; H, severe case admitted to the hospital but not in intensive care; R, recovered; D, deceased School closure: the contact matrix for school is removed. We consider that 5% of adults may stay at home to take care of children while schools are closed (not applied with telework or lockdown). Telework performed by a given % of individuals: contacts at work and on transports are reduced to account for the % of workers not going to work anymore. In France, telework is performed daily by 6% of the active adult population [37]. Here we consider three values: 25%, 50% (as declared by participants of a crowdsourced system monitoring COVID-19-associated behaviors in France [38] ), and 70%. The 70% reduction is considered during lockdown, informed by the reduction of mobility documented during the first weeks of lockdown, and resulting from the analysis of mobile phone data in the region [39] . The percentages associated to telework more generally include all individuals not going to their place of work (because they work remotely, they stopped working due to restrictions, or other conditions). Household contacts are increased proportionally to each adult staying at home based on statistics comparing weekend vs. weekday contacts [17] and proportion of adults working during the weekend [40] . Senior isolation: contacts established by seniors are reduced by a given % to model a marked social distancing targeting only the age class at higher risk of complications. We consider 75% and 90%. Banning of social events and closure of all nonessential activities: Contacts established during leisure and other activities are completely or partially (50%) removed. Case isolation: in a scenario with large-scale and rapid testing availability, we consider that 25%, 50%, or 75% of all infectious individuals (also including asymptomatic) reduce promptly their contacts by 90% throughout their illness as they self-isolate. This simulates the outcome of aggressive contact-tracing and isolation [31, 41] . To account for a delay in tracing, testing, and self-isolation, we consider that infected individuals in their prodromic stage maintain their contacts as in the no-intervention scenario.\\nCombinations of the above social distancing interventions simulate the lockdown and alternative less strict options as exit strategies (Table 1) . Physical contacts during lockdown are removed to account for the adoption of physical distancing; an alternative version of the matrix maintaining physical contacts during lockdown is tested for sensitivity. We explore possible progressive exit of specific categories of individuals from lockdown (e.g., gradually reopening some businesses while still requiring a high rate of telework where possible), while maintaining strict social distancing for those at higher risk of complications (e.g., protecting seniors through isolation), as well as increasing testing capacities over time. Results without physical contacts in the exit strategies are tested for sensitivity analysis.\\nIntervention scenarios are based on the nationwide implementation of the lockdown in France from March 17, 2020, up to May 11. Timelines of explored scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 3 . Different durations of the lockdown (till the end of April, end of May) are also considered for sensitivity.\\nThe model is calibrated on hospital data [28] specifying the number of COVID-19-positive hospital admissions in Île-de-France prior to lockdown. We use a maximum likelihood approach to fit the transmission rate per contact and the starting date of the simulation considering data in the interval March 1-23, 2020 (Additional file 1). Hospital admissions in the interval March 17-23 were included as still not affected by lockdown, due to the delay between date of infection and date of hospitalization (~1 week). Parameters estimating the hospital trajectories of COVID-19 patients are based on data up to April 5.\\nWe also retrospectively fit the epidemic trajectory during the lockdown phase, once data became available, to estimate the deviation from our assumptions (Additional file 1).\\nThe simulated incidence of clinical cases (mild and severe symptoms) is compared to the regional incidence of COVID-19 cases estimated by the syndromic and virological surveillance system [29, 42] (see also Additional file 1) from week 12 (March 16 to 22, 2020). Validation is performed a posteriori on the epidemic trajectories of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and ICU beds' occupation, during the full lockdown period, once data became available.\\nEach intervention of social distancing is compared to the no-intervention scenario in terms of final attack rate, peak time, peak incidence, and ICU beds' demand in the region. The total number of ICU beds in Île-de-France has progressively increased over time up to a capacity of 2800 ICU beds [43] in an effort to sustain the first wave and respond to the emergency (Fig. 1) . Passed the first wave, we consider an ICU capacity restored at 1500 beds in the months following the emergency [44] , as the emergency response is not sustainable in the long term. This capacity corresponds to a 25% increase compared to standard pre-COVID-19 size (1147 beds), assuming that a certain level of preparedness is kept in the upcoming months to face the possible evolution of the pandemic.\\nFor each scenario, we perform 250 stochastic runs; median curves are displayed together with the associated 95% probability ranges.\\nResults reported in the main paper refer to p a = 0.2; those for p a = 0.5 are shown in the Additional file 1. We compare the lockdown based on our reconstructed matrix with (i) a less stringent lockdown under the reduction of contacts measured in the UK [45] , (ii) a more stringent lockdown under the reduction of contacts measured in China [46] , (iii) a fit of the model during the lockdown phase, (iv) an additional version of our reconstructed matrix where physical contacts are kept. Exit strategies Exit 1-4 are also examined with a lockdown lifted at the beginning of May, or of June, and assuming that physical contacts are avoided in the upcoming months. In addition, we test different relative susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults. We did not consider scenarios assuming that infectiousness is constant across asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, as in contrast with available evidence [8, 23] . Table 1 Combinations of social distancing interventions. Telework under intensive measures refers to the ensemble of individuals who remain at home (including teleworkers, but also those who do not work anymore because of the lockdown, to care for children, or other conditions)\\nThe reproductive number for our model is estimated to be R 0 = 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval), computed with the next-generation approach [47] based on the transmission rate estimated from hospital admissions in Île-de-France prior to lockdown (Fig. 4) .\\nReported hospitalizations are consistent with an epidemic seeded in the region at the end of January 2020. The percentage of population in Île-de-France predicted to be infected on May 11 ranges from 2 to 13% considering both values of the probability of being asymptomatic (Fig. 4 , and Additional file 1 for the higher asymptomatic rate scenario). Overall infection fatality ratio is estimated to range from 0.7 to 1.2%.

This allows a substantial reduction of the reproductive number well below 1 (R LD = 0.68 [0.66, 0.69]). Under these conditions, the predicted incidence of clinical cases slows down and reduces during lockdown, following the tendency reported by syndromic and virological surveillance (Fig. 4) . The overestimation of clinical cases is explained with a consultation rate estimated to be around 35% in the reported period, as documented from crowdsourced data [38] (Fig. S3 in Appendix file 1). Fitting the model to the epidemic trajectory during the lockdown phase would require a correction of 5% increase in the transmissibility per contact ( Fig. 4 and Additional file 1).\\nThe predicted number of ICU beds occupied saturates towards the strengthened capacity in the region, before slowly decelerating and reducing over time. Predictions are consistent with observations (Fig. 5) Fig. 4 (of which 18 [10, 30] in ICUs), with an ICU system occupied at 48 [31, 68] % of currently strengthened capacity (Fig. 5) .\\nAssuming a 90% decrease during lockdown predicts faster decrease in bed occupation (Fig. 5) . With a less stringent reduction (73%), R LD is just below 1, and the trend of occupied beds in ICUs is predicted to continue to increase up to end of April. None of these situations is consistent with the data. Considering physical contacts during lockdown would lead to a higher occupancy of ICU beds than observed.\\nLifting the lockdown with no exit strategy, and going back to normal conditions, leads to a delay of the peak compared to the no-intervention scenario (delay of about the duration of the lockdown) with minimal effect on peak incidence (Fig. 6) .

The median prediction of our model is also shown for comparison (red curve). In all plots, vertical dashed line refers to the start of the lockdown, horizontal lines refer to ICU capacity in the region (see Fig. 1b) , and shaded areas correspond to 95% probability ranges. Results are shown for p a = 0.2 beds required is estimated to be more than 60 times the restored regional capacity if no strategy is implemented after lockdown.\\nCombined interventions of different degrees of intensity implemented indefinitely after lifting the lockdown in May substantially delay and mitigate the epidemic (Fig. 6) . School closure coupled with senior isolation, and mild interventions reduce the peak incidence by approximately half (40%, 58% respectively). Interventions of moderate intensity or higher (i.e., schools are closed, 50% of active individuals work remotely, and at least 50% of non-essential activities are closed; seniors remain in isolation) suppress the peak with more than 80% reduction gaining significant delay compared to the noexit strategy. Despite the strong mitigation of these scenarios, the peak demand on the healthcare system is predicted however to exceed capacity by a large amount if interventions are at most of moderate intensity (15 to 40 times higher than capacity) (Fig. 6) . Strict intervention would still require twice the restored capacity of the system during the second wave.\\nImplementing aggressive case finding and isolation together with social distancing allow the release of the lockdown in May, engaging the ICU services below their maximum capacity throughout the epidemic (Fig. 7) . On the medium-to long-term, different intensity of social distancing interventions can be maintained, depending on the testing and isolation capacity, for example, strict interventions if only 25% of cases are promptly identified and isolated (Exit 2), or moderate interventions if such capacity is increased (50% case isolation, Exit 1). These two scenarios predict the occupation of more than 500 beds in ICU up to the month of June. Lifting the lockdown at the beginning of May would maintain ICU occupation over this level for the entire summer (Additional file 1). Delaying till early June would achieve a stronger suppression of the epidemic.\\nFurther relaxing social distancing constraints (e.g., allowing a larger proportion of individuals to go to work and the full reopening of activities) would be possible by progressively going through decreasing levels of intensity of interventions (from lockdown to strict interventions to mild interventions afterwards) while maintaining highly efficient tracing (Exit 3). Alternatively, strict and mild interventions can be rotated every month if case isolation capacity is less efficient (Exit 4).\\nAll these scenarios foresee, however, that schools are closed, and seniors remain isolated. All exit strategies would be able to maintain the epidemic under control in the upcoming months if a larger Fig. 6 Simulated impact of lockdown of different durations and exit strategies. a Simulated daily incidence of clinical cases assuming lockdown till end of April, May 11, and end of May. b Corresponding demand of ICU beds. c Simulated daily incidence of clinical cases assuming lockdown till May 11, followed by interventions of varying degree of intensity. d Corresponding demand of ICU beds. e Relative reduction of peak incidence and epidemic size after 1 year for each scenario. f Peak ICU demand relative to restored ICU capacity of the region (1500 beds). In all panels, the color code is as in Table 1 , and scenarios are identified as reported in Fig. 3 . Vertical colored areas indicate the time period of lockdown under the different measures. Baseline scenario corresponds to no intervention. Results are shown for p a = 0.2. Shaded areas correspond to 95% probability ranges proportion of infected individuals are asymptomatic. This is due to the smaller fraction of individuals in the population with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization (Additional file 1). If younger children and adolescents are less susceptible than older age classes, transmissions would mainly occur from infectious adults and seniors. A higher transmission rate, with respect to the equal susceptibility scenario, is thus required to reproduce the epidemic trajectory prior to lockdown. This is due to the fact that younger age classes have a large number of contacts, but these contacts become less important in the disease spread if individuals are less susceptible to contract the infection. In the scenario analyses, the reduced susceptibility assumption would lead on average to a higher flux of hospital admissions, as older age classes are the ones with higher probability of being hospitalized. Exit strategies however exist that would maintain the epidemic under control (Additional file 1). Also, changes in the risk of transmission from younger children would lead to similar results. If individuals continue to avoid all physical contacts in the next months, all exit strategies considered here foresee the suppression of the epidemic in the region (Additional file 1).\\nWe use a stochastic age-structured epidemic transmission model calibrated on hospital admission data in Îlede-France to evaluate the impact of lockdown and exit strategies in controlling COVID-19 epidemic in the region. Our estimate of the reproductive number prior to lockdown is in line with estimates for the epidemic growth in Europe prior to the implementation of interventions [9, 10] , with results from a meta-analysis of the literature [12, 45] , and with concurrent studies in France [35, 48] . We predict it decreased significantly during lockdown with a 95% probability range well below 1. Under these conditions, the occupancy of the ICU system reaches a plateau before clearly showing a decreasing tendency after several weeks of lockdown, as also observed in other countries [18] . As of May 11, the model predicts a 48% of ICU occupancy, with less than 30 new admissions to ICUs per day.\\nLifting lockdown with no exit strategy in place, i.e., going back to pre-lockdown conditions, would inevitably lead to large rebound effects, as the immunity of the population is estimated to be still very low (from 2 to 13% considering both values of probability of being asymptomatic explored), Fig. 7 Simulated impact of lockdown and exit strategies with large-scale testing and case isolation. a Simulated daily new number of clinical cases assuming the progressive exit strategies illustrated in Fig. 3 . b Corresponding demand of ICU beds. c As in a with exit strategies implemented after a lockdown till the end of May. d Corresponding demand of ICU beds in agreement with other estimates [9, 35] . Prolonged interventions of moderate to high intensity could additionally delay the epidemic peak by at least 2 months compared to the no-exit strategy and reduce its peak incidence by more than 80%, but would not avoid exceeding ICU capacity (peak demand of 2-15 times the restored ICU capacity of the region). Even with a 100% increase of ICU capacity to face the second peak, strict interventions would be required for the next full year.\\nControl of the epidemic without overwhelming the healthcare system requires coupling social distancing measures with aggressive testing to promptly identify infectious individuals and isolate them. Response capacity is critical to lift the lockdown, so that the timeline of these interventions should be carefully planned based on achieved preparedness. We consider different levels of testing capacity starting from the month of May or June. If case isolation is performed on average 1.5 day after infection and is efficient (90% reduction of contacts), we find that identifying at least 50% of all new cases would be required to rapidly reduce the burden on the healthcare system while exiting lockdown. Lower tracing capacity starting May would need to be coupled with more vigorous social distancing to keep the epidemic under control. To release constraints on the population while building capacity, a longer lockdown till June would aid releasing the pressure on the healthcare system. Also, it would be ideal to perform contact tracing and testing while the epidemic is at low activity levels. The benefit of these measures would go beyond the epidemic mitigation and extend to revising and optimizing protocols to improve case finding and isolation-compared to the first phase of the epidemic-under more controlled conditions (reduced mixing of the population).\\nFast, efficient, and large-scale contact tracing [31] is one essential component allowing the partial release of social distancing constraints in the upcoming months. This would require digital technologies that are currently being investigated in Europe [49] following the examples of COVID-19 response of countries in Asia [50] . Logistical constraints need to be envisioned, including large-scale and rapid diagnostic capacity, large-scale adoption of the contact tracing technology by the population [51] , uptake of recommendations, and coordination across countries to allow contact tracing across borders [49] .\\nThe set of mild or moderate interventions considered here still impose limitations. We tested strategies allowing a larger proportion of the population to go back to work, also to partially release the huge economic pressure that lockdown generated. Global economic uncertainty is at a record high [52] , due to the fear of COVID-19 pandemic spread, income losses, and globally stalled economies because of exceptional interventions freezing production. As a side effect, lockdown has likely created a forced opportunity to re-organize certain professional activities to make telework possible and efficient at larger scale than previously foreseen. Prior to lockdown, a small fraction of Europeans practiced telework [37] . If this change of paradigm is maintained beyond emergency response, it would be extremely valuable in the medium-to long-term to aid the control of the epidemic below healthcare system saturation. Rotation of individuals working from home (e.g., every week, or every 2 weeks) can be envisioned to maintain the required social distancing levels in the community while ensuring real-life connections.\\nHere we consider unchanged intervention measures regarding children and seniors across all scenarios. Schools are assumed to remain closed, though reopening of certain school levels is possible under different protocols of attendance [44] . Seniors are considered to maintain a reduction of contacts through hygienic measures and physical distance, as they are especially vulnerable against COVID-19. Planning for the upcoming months under these conditions should include logistics to facilitate daily routines of the elderly beyond this phase of emergency, e.g., improving delivery of grocery and medicines, facilitating remote access to healthcare, providing learning programs for the use of technologies to stay connected, and other initiatives. Reopening of the schools in the fall/winter should be explored in the following months once the impact of these interventions will be further assessed [44] .\\nICU capacity underwent a large increase in the last weeks to face the rapid surge of patients in critical conditions [16] . Capacities have been stretched in the most affected regions, and patients have also been transferred to other regions for adequate care. Exiting the current emergency, we envision that ICU capacity will be restored to lower levels for the upcoming months. If a second emergency were to occur, the system would need to be strengthened again to higher limits.\\nOur findings are based on the mechanistically reconstructed changes in the contact matrices that aim to reproduce the implemented social distancing measures, as done in previous works [7, 12] . While reconstructing changes in the contact matrices remains arbitrary, available elements support our estimates. First, not being fitted to the lockdown period, our contact matrices reconstructed from social contact data lead to model projections in line with observations across several indicators. The fit to the epidemic trajectory, retrospectively performed once data became available, shows that a correction of only 5% in the transmissibility per contact is needed to better describe the epidemic compared to our mechanistically reconstructed matrices. This indicates that the assumptions behind the reconstruction of the matrix, affecting each age bracket in a different way, are able to capture the dynamics of the epidemic during lockdown.\\nSuch finding can improve the parameterization of similar models based on contact matrices for the study of COVID-19 epidemic in other regions or countries. At the same time, it also suggests that physical contacts were successfully avoided during lockdown, in compliance with the recommendations of health authorities. Second, our predicted reduction of 81% of the average number of contacts during lockdown is lower than the one measured in China in the cities of Wuhan (86%) and Shanghai (89%) [46] . Stricter measures were implemented in China during lockdown compared to Europe, including for example complete suspension of public transport, ban of cars from roads except for the essential services, barring residents from leaving the apartment in certain areas or limiting it to one household member few days per week, performing health checks door to door to identify and isolate ill individuals. These measures are expected therefore to have a more substantial effect on reducing the number of contacts per individual compared to social distancing measures implemented in many European countries. Indeed, under conditions measured in China, the ICU system is predicted by our model to receive less patients and clear them more rapidly than what we currently see in the data. Third, our prediction for contact reduction is close to, but larger than the empirically estimated 73% reduction of a recent social contact survey conducted in the UK during the lockdown phase [45] . Implementation of social distancing however differs in the two countries. For example, in the UK, parks remain open, no self-declaration to circulate is needed, and displacements are not restricted on distance. Assuming the conditions measured in the UK, the model predicts a first peak exceeding ICU capacity. Collecting contact data in France during lockdown, as done in the UK, would allow a better measurement of the mixing patterns altered by social distancing to be compared with our synthetically reconstructed lockdown matrix. Possible changes in population adherence over time, and consequential strengthening of measures by authorities, need however to be taken into account.\\nOur study is affected by limitations. We did not include explicitly the effect of using masks. Evidence on seasonal coronaviruses indicates that surgical masks may reduce onward transmission [53] . Masks are largely adopted or enforced in Asia, while they just became a recommended or compulsory protection in certain areas in Europe and the USA, mainly as a precautionary measure [54] . If effective, their widespread use may help decrease the risk of transmission in the community. As more epidemiological evidence accrues, this effect can be taken into account and help further alleviate control measures. We did not consider seasonal behavior in viral transmission [11, 13] , because of current lack of evidence. In our simulated epidemics, multiple peaks are observed because of the implementation of social distancing interventions able to reduce the reproductive number below 1. If seasonal forcing is to be expected, the interplay with seasonality should be carefully considered in the planning of the short-and long-term control strategies [11] . Exit strategies are based on matrices including both physical and non-physical contacts. We saw that excluding physical contacts substantially contributed to the reduction of the reproductive number during lockdown. At this stage, however, large uncertainty exists on recommendations and protocols imposed by authorities to phase out lockdown. Moreover, our scenarios plan out for several months, and recommendations as well as population adoption may strongly change over this long time period. Findings reported in the main text therefore correspond to a conservative choice. If physical contacts are avoided for several months, the epidemic would go locally extinct. Treatment of COVID-19 patients improved over time, as documented by lower probabilities for requiring intensive care and shorter durations in ICU (Additional file 1). These data became available at the time of revision and were not included in the analysis. The more efficient management of COVID-19 patients is expected to reduce the burden in the upcoming months.\\nWe tested two values for the probability of being asymptomatic, as there still exists large uncertainty [20] [21] [22] [23] . Few studies investigated the clinical progression of symptoms over time until viral clearance. Additional household studies now launched in Europe will help providing a better understanding of the presence of asymptomatic cases and their contribution to transmission. Evidence so far seems to indicate that this fraction may be low [23] ; therefore, we presented in the main paper results for p a = 0.2. Estimates of age-specific severity and case fatality rates are still rapidly evolving and often vary across countries due to different surveillance systems and testing protocols in place. Here we used estimates of age-specific severity informed from a modelbased analysis on individual-level data from China and other countries [19] . Rates describing the hospitalization duration and outcome of a patient were based on French data [28] . Infection fatality ratios estimated by our model are consistent with estimates provided in Ref. [19] . We do not consider here data on comorbidities that will alter hospitalization and fatality rates. Large-scale testing in France will allow us to robustly estimate age-specific hospitalization rates to better inform the model.\\nConcurrently to our work, other studies became available that assessed the epidemic in France [35, 48] . All studies independently produced similar estimates characterizing the epidemic and the effectiveness of lockdown, providing a consensus of evaluations despite modeling discrepancies (e.g., equal transmissibility across asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals in Ref. [35] , or 90% reduction in transmissibility of asymptomatic cases in Ref. [48] , compared to our 45% reduction informed by prior modeling work [8] ). However, each focused on different aspects, specifically to evaluate the impact of lockdown and estimate population immunity [35] , or to estimate the total number of averted ICU admissions and deaths due to lockdown [48] , whereas no study proposed exit strategies and their evaluation while on lockdown.\\nOur results are based on data from Île-de-France, currently one of the most affected regions by the COVID-19 epidemic in the country, and not directly applicable to other regions. Few differences in the results due to variations of age profile across regions are to be expected [55] . The most relevant changes will however result from the different epidemic phase experienced by each region at the moment of nationwide application of the lockdown. Overall, findings on exit strategies remain valid, but more specific interventions, differentially targeting the regions, may be envisioned.\\nFrance, as many other countries in the world, implemented a nationwide lockdown to curb the dramatic increase in the number of patients in critical conditions. Assessing the impact of lockdown and identifying the optimal strategies to manage the health crisis beyond lockdown is of critical importance. Substantial social distancing will be needed in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Given the features of COVID-19 pandemic, extensive case finding and isolation following lockdown are required to progressively lower the intensity of current interventions and avoid that the healthcare system exceeds saturation. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.\\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12916-020-01698-4.\\nAdditional file 1. Supplementary material composed of supplementary results, Tables S1 and S2, and Figures S1-S10.\", \"Since November 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) caused by the new coronavirus (CoV-2) is the most severe pandemic of the past 50 years.\\nCoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the ß-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications [1] .\\nIn this case, targets for research would be the receptor used by SARS to enter the cells to be infected, ACE2, the RNA polymerase or the virus protease (Mpro), needed for fusion, replication, and embudding of new viruses in the host cells. Thus, entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research.\\nThe ClinicalTrials.gov webpage currently (10.01.2021) lists 376 clinical trials related to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 of which 15 are found to be completed, although this might not be the real number due to the fact that investigators often do report final study data with time delay. Taken together with a small number of further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, the current evidence of drug treatment of COVID-19 is scarce. Thus, the majority of studies is planned or currently recruiting.\\nThis review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and rationale for clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and other nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide.\\nNucleoside analogs have been already studied as potential therapeutic options against SARS infection. In general, these drugs are taken as prodrugs and have to be phosphorylated in the target cells to be active false components used by RNA polymerase leading to the abruption of viral RNA replication. This principle has been used as part of antiretroviral therapies for decades [2] .\\nA number of in silico and in vitro studies evaluated the binding of drugs to RNA polymerase and protease [3] [4] [5] [6] .\\nThe proteinase processing polyprotein and virus maturation is called main protease (Mpro) and has already been evaluated as an approach towards SARS treatment [7, 8] . We also know from HIV treatment, that HIV-1 protease inhibitors are highly able to deactivate Mpro by inactivating the active center of the protease being nominated as a potential drug against SARS infection [9] . Therefore, studies have been designed to evaluate the molecular interaction of HIV-1 protease inhibitors with Mpro, which are discussed later on.\\nSofosbuvir, remdesivir, and tenofovir-DF (TDF) are nucleos(t)ide analogs and thus prodrugs, which are 2-3× phosphorylated in the target cells in order to become active false components used by RNA polymerase leading to the abruption of viral RNA replication. Sofosbuvir is a uridineanalog, remdesivir is an adenosine-analog and tenofovirdisoproxilfumarate is a thymidine-analog. Most of the chainterminating drugs are nucleoside-analogs missing a functional 3'OH-group (e.g., tenofovir, aciclovir or azidothymidin). Sofosbuvir is an exemption, because it is modified at the 2'OH-group for better antiviral activity against HCV. All of these can cause a premature chain termination by steric inhibition of the viral polymerase [10, 11] . Of these, ribavirin showed the highest binding energy to RNA polymerase (7.8 ckal/mol), but is followed by remdesivir (7.6), sofosbuvir (7.5), galidesvir (7.0), and tenofovir-DF (6.9) [10] .\\nRemdesivir was found to be active against Ebola, although the results were not as encouraging as expected [12] .\\nAnalyses of patients (n=66, US, EU, and China) who received remdesivir in a compassionate use program showed, that Remdesivir standard dosing can improve the pulmonary status, help clear the virus and decrease fever in patients with severe COVID-19, especially those who had an O 2 -saturation <94% and who were oxygenated [13] .\\nRemdesivir is now tested in trials worldwide. The two biggest trials, SOLIDARITY and DISCOVERY, initiated by the WHO and the French ANSM plan to enroll thousands of patients worldwide, of which 3200 will be included in countries of the European Union under the guidance of the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM). The SOLIDARITY trial is an open randomized adaptive controlled trial, where patients are either assigned to receive remdesivir intravenously 100 mg daily for the duration of the hospitalization and up to 10 days total course, including a loading dose of 200 mg at inclusion or hydroxychloroquine will be given orally (in the ICU in gastrointestinal tubes) with 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg every day for a total of 10 days, plus standard of care treatment (SOC) in each arm [14] .\\nThe manufacturer of remdesivir, Gilead Sciences Inc., also announced the initiation of two phase 3 clinical studies in March 2020 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in adults diagnosed with COVID-19. These randomized, open-label, multicenter studies will enroll approximately 1000 patients at medical centers primarily across Asian countries, as well as other countries globally with high numbers of diagnosed cases. The studies will assess two dosing durations of remdesivir, administered intravenously.\\nRecently, remdesivir has been approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients, being hospitalized and O 2 -ventilated. Data on remdesivir were assessed in an exceptionally short timeframe through a socalled rolling review, an approach used by EMA during public health emergencies to assess data as they become available. From April 30, 2020, the CHMP began assessing data on quality and manufacturing, non-clinical data, preliminary clinical data, and supporting safety data from compassionate use programs, well in advance of the submission of the marketing authorization application on the 5th of June 2020. The recommendation was mainly based on data from study NIAID-ACTT-1. Preliminary results of this study indicate that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. Results also suggested a survival benefit, with a mortality rate of 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group (p=0.059) [15] .\\nClinicalTrials.gov lists a total number of 10 trials with remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 infection (01.08.2020, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term= remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) Also, two substantial reviews came to the conclusion that remdesivir is the foremost candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 patients who receive mechanical ventilation [16, 17] .\\nIn Italy, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled (1:1) clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of favipiravir in the treatment of adult subjects with COVID-19-moderate type started in July 2020. Subjects within 10 days of COVID-19 onset will be screened and be randomized as early as possible within 24 h following screen success. It is planned to randomize 100 subjects in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in the test group will receive supportive care recommended in the current guidelines + favipiravir, and subjects in the control group will receive supportive care recommended in the current guidelines + placebo control; the efficacy and safety of favipiravir versus the placebo in the treatment of COVID-19-moderate type will be compared [18] .\\nA Chinese multicenter interventional trial evaluates the combination of Favipiravir combined with tocilizumab. 150 participants will be assigned to receive either the combination of favipiravir or favipiravir or tocilizumab alone, each plus SOC.\\nFavipiravir will be given 1600mg BID on the 1st day and 600 mg BID from day 2 to 7, p.o.\\nThe first dose of tocilizumab is 4~8 mg/kg as i.v. infusion and the recommended dose is 400 mg. For fever patients, an additional application (the same dose as before) is given if there is still fever within 24 h after the first dose and the interval between two medications ≥ 12 h. The maximum cumulative number is two, and the maximum single dose is up to 800 mg [19] .\\nFinally, an 8-armed study with planned 320 participants will test various combinations of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, oseltamivir, favipiravir, and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment COVID-19 (THDMS-COVID-19) in Bangkok, Thailand. (01.08.2020, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04303299? term=favipiravir&cond=COVID-19&draw=2&rank=3).\\nThere are no current studies listed for sofosbuvir in ClinicalTrials.gov.\\nFour Trials are listed for oseltamivir, a drug against influenza infection, inhibiting the neuraminidase and thus, the viral spreading after infection of a patient. They do neither eliminate the virus nor are they able to substantially shorten the course of flu disease in patients. Oseltamivir is considered to be helpful in case of a pandemic in order to decrease the viral spread in society. [20, 21] However, an effect against SARS-CoV-2 has never been proven in vitro or in vivo. (https:// clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term= oseltamivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) Ribavirin was tested in vitro 2004 against SARS-CoV and revealed a limited effect on the elimination of SARS-CoV-1; however, the authors concluded that from their pk-data it must be expected that effective concentrations in humans will not be reached by approved human doses [20] . However, ribavirin revealed a higher binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase than remdesivir in recent in silico and in vitro studies [10] .\\nOne RCT in Sichuan, China, should be reported evaluating the combination of tenofovir-alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/ FTC). Although there are no in silico or in vitro data for the binding of TAF to SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the Chinese study plans to evaluate the combination of LPV/r+TAF/FTC vs. LPV/r alone in 60 patients each for the early treatment of COVID-19.\\nRecruiting is still pending due to the International Clinical trials Registry Platform of the WHO (01.08.2020, https://apps.who.int/ trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=ChiCTR2000029468).\\nFinally, there are two new studies, already recruiting, listed in the FDA ClinicalTrials.gov database, accessed 10.01.2021: A French trial (AR0-CORONA) evaluates the Effect of Tenofovir/ Emtricitabine Short Course on Viral Clearance in Patients Recently Infected With SARS-COV2 (covid-19) Not Requiring Hospitalization. The investigators propose a multicenter, openlabel, phase 2B/3 randomized trial of a 7-day treatment with TDF/FTC (2 tablets on day 1, then 1 tablet/day for 6 days) according to the dosage used in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. This study is ought to include 60 outpatients (phase 2B) and 120 additional outpatients (phase III) who are diagnosed with SARS-CoV2-positive and have no contraindication to TDF/FTC, without criteria for hospitalization. The primary endpoint of the phase 2B is the SARS-CoV2 antiviral efficacy, quantified by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal sample CT-value increase on day 4 compared to baseline. The primary endpoint of phase 3 will be the rate of noncontagious RT-PCR on day 4 from a nasopharyngeal sample. Secondary endpoints will be tolerance, symptoms resolution, percentage of hospitalization, and the rate of non-contagious RT-PCR on day 7 from a nasopharyngeal sample. This is one of the first studies evaluating an antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in an outpatient setting, something the ambulatory sector of especially general practitioners are waiting for, since they are currently treating over 90% of all COVID-19 cases.\\n(10.01.2021, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT04685512?term=tenofovir&cond=covid-19&draw= 2&rank=1)\\nThe second RCT from Colombia refers to the evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological therapies used to treat adult patients with COVID-19. Adults aged 18 years or over with a positive RT-PCR or with high suspicion of SARS CoV-2 infection and diagnosis of mild, severe, or critical pneumonia, requiring hospital management at six hospitals in Colombia will be treated with either (1) emtricitabine/tenofovir, (2) colchicine plus rosuvastatin, (3) Emtricitabine/tenofovir plus colchicine plus rosuvastatin, and (4) standard od care (SOC). The study aims to recruit n=400 patients in the first step to select the most effective and safe treatments, listed above, and 1200 patients in a second phase evaluating the effectiveness of the selected treatments. The primary outcome is mortality at days 7 and 28. Furthermore, serious adverse events, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, requirement of respiratory support, time to death, number of participants cured, and any adverse event related to treatment will be assessed. Variables for statistical adjustment are sociodemographic and clinical at recruitment, i.e., comorbidities, need for therapeutic support, grade of invasion at admission. ( \\nIn general, the nucleoside analogs can affect the bone marrow and blood cell count, causing hemolytic anemia, decreased hemoglobin and thrombocytopenia. Tenofovir-DF can also decrease bone density and alter kidney function with increased creatinine values. Proteinuria is a symptom of a possible Fanconi-syndrome. Nucleoside analogs also may cause mitochondrial toxicity with peripheral subcutaneous fat loss. However, these side effects usually occur after a long-term intake of NAs, in short periods of treatment such as against SARS-CoV, these side effects only play a minor role. The foremost side effects in the first weeks of treatment are nausea, dizziness, headache, and diarrhea.\\nAs there is a similarity in the nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 of 79% and to MERS-CoV of 51.8%, and protease is a key enzyme for the replication of coronaviruses, there are data from previous studies in these earlier endemics, which are translated now into therapy concepts for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.\\nLopinavir/r was one of four FDA-approved drugs, which were effective against SARS-CoV in cell lines [21] , but later investigations revealed contradictory results [3, 5, 22, 23] and the question occurs why this could be. The EC 50 of Lopinavir was 8μM [21] which is usually reached by BID dosing of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra®) 400/100mg in vivo [24] , if the drug concentrations in plasma are measured as entire concentration; however, the unbound fraction of Lopinavir is much lower in the plasma due to its protein binding capacity of 98-99%.\\nDayer et al. have tested the inhibitory potency of HIV-1 protease inhibitors to coronavirus protease and found the inhibitory potency represented by the similarity of the tested d r u g s t o t h e c e r t a i n b i n d i n g s i t e o f M p r o o f LPV>RTV>APV>TPV>SQV>ATV>DRV>NFV>IDV, so that in this case, LPV was the most powerful inhibitor of coronavirus protease. The inhibitory potency of Lopinavir in a molecular dynamic simulation was represented by the binding site similarity of 66.67%, whereas the second-generation PI Darunavir/Cobicistat (DRV/COBI) revealed a binding site similarity of 33, 3% [25] . In addition, Nukoolkarn et al. have found in their molecular dynamics simulations, that the active site SARS-CoV 3CL pro is binding to lopinavir/ritonavir through hydrogen bonds [5] .\\nIn a retrospective cohort study, n=33 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without invasive ventilation were given either oral umifenavir (Arbidol®) + LPV/r in the combination group (n=16) or oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group (n=17) for 5-21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis (day 7, day 14), and it was assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day 7). Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12 (75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after 7 days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0.05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52.9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p < 0.05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11 (69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after 7 days, compared with 5 (29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p < 0.05) [26] .\\nIn a randomized, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) of 94% or less, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LPV/r (LPV/r, 400 mg, and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the LPV/r group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with LPV/r was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the LPV/r group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference,−5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, LPV/r led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the LPV/r group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard care group. LPV/r treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events [27] .\\nLPV/r was also tested in human cell lines and a mouse model against MERS-CoV and revealed lesser therapeutic effects than previously reported. Antiviral activity (EC 50 ) in a human lung cell line at concentrations of 8.5μM was low. LPV/r did not stop weight loss or improve hemorrhage, but LPV/r improved pulmonary function in vivo, measured by accessing the FEV1 (Sheahan et al. 2020 Nature).\\nThe side effects of HIV-PI are well known and have been extensively studied over the past two decades. The most limiting side effects occur during long-term treatment and include especially lipodystrophy [28] and cardiovascular side effects, which can be life-threatening. But one has to take into account that treatment against COVID-19 will be of very limited duration, so that most probably only short-term side effects will occur, especially headache, dizziness, and diarrhea, well known from the early days of HIV-1 treatment. The University of Liverpool Drug Interaction Database also evaluated contraindications and potential drug-drug interactions between DAAs and antiretrovirals. It was stated that the least contraindications/interactions were found with Sofosbuvir (0.2%/0%) [29, 30] .\\nThe interaction potential of ritonavir-boosted HIV-protease inhibitors unfortunately is quite high, so that it is a challenge to combine LPV/r with other currently taken drugs in multimorbid elderly patients, who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19.\\nCytochrome oxidases (CYP) are involved in human drug metabolism, especially during the intestinal absorption and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Around 60% of all drugs are metabolized via CYP-isoenzymes. Of these~40% via CYP3A, 25% via CYP2C, 18% via CYP1A, and another 18% via other CYPs. The most important human cytochrome oxidases are CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Other important metabolizing hepatic enzymes are transferases, e.g., UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT) and Nacetyltransferase (NAT).\\nRegarding the complexity and number of potential DDIs between, especially LPV/RTV and co-medication, the author refers to the package inserts and EMA-INN. Also, the University of Liverpool drug-drug interaction webpage gives a very comprehensive overview (Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4) .\\nOn their way into target cells, drugs have to overcome different cellular barriers. This can happen by passive diffusion but in many cases also by means of active transport proteins. Most familiar is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), called ABCB1 transporter in new nomenclature, a transmembrane glycoprotein efflux transporter, encoded by the MDR1 gene. This membranelocated ATP-dependent transport mechanism is used by human cells to discharge toxins or drugs identified as toxins.\\nIn humans, P-gp is located in excretory tissues like the intestine, liver, and kidney, but also in the pancreas, heart, and brain or, e.g., tumor cells. The overexpression in tumor cells, e.g., is one reason for the decreased response to cytostatics, known as multidrug resistance. The spectrum of substrates of P-gp is broad and includes drugs, food constitutes, environmental toxins, hormones, amino acids, sugar, or peptides, i.e., molecules from 400 to 2000 Da. P-gp can be either inhibited or induced, whereas substrates of P-gp often are also substrates of CYP3A4 (Table 5) . Obviously, the expression and activity of both are regulated via the same pathways. Thus, the differentiation of effects caused by each is complicated.\\nA number of drugs discussed in this editorial are substrates and/or inhibitors of P-gp (Table 5 ).\\nThe number of ongoing studies regarding the treatment of COVID-19 is impressive:\\nClinicalTrials.gov lists 469 studies worldwide (01.10. 2020), of which 376 are still active (10.01.2021), but current evidence for the treatment of COVID 19 still is quite low.\\nThere are reasonable arguments from in vitro and drug modeling studies as well as small open trials or case reports supporting the repurposing of already available drugs and possible combinations of such.\\nHowever, some turn out to cause more problems in real life than possibly expected. In Sweden, recently all studies with hydroxychloroquine were stopped due to the accumulation of severe side effects in patients (International Press). A pilot study of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of patients with common coronavirus disease-19 revealed expected side effects: Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (p>0.05). The authors conclude that the prognosis of common COVID-19 patients is good. However, the results are neither valid nor very encouraging for hydroxychloroquine [47] .\\nA 200-mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine has a half-life of 537 h or 22.4 days in the blood, and 2963 h or 123.5 days in the plasma. Patients experiencing an overdose may present with headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm, and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation [48, 49] (FDA-Approved Drug Products: Hydroxychloroquine Oral Tablets). This may progress to sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest. Another concern is irreversible retina damage, when taken over a longer period. Although these side effects are rare, the result can be dramatic. [50] The use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients has recently been halted at several Swedish hospitals due to reported side effects such as cramps and loss of peripheral vision. (01.07.2020, https://www.webmd. com/lung/news/20200407/side-effects-halt-use-of-chloroquinevs-COVID- 19) .\\nRemdesivir seems to be the most promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, but as 68.5% of all studies investigate Remdesivir + X, this could cause problems if the drug reveals either less efficacy than expected or side effects which were not obvious in the past in the very limited number of patients treated because of Ebola infection. In this case, trials and alternative treatments with other comparators would be missing. In addition, remdesivir is produced by one single manufacturer, so that production capacities' supply chains may not match with the worldwide requirement of COVID-19 treatment, the more as the USA already bought 500.000 doses of remdesivir in July, which represents the entire worldwide production July-September 2020.\\nIn addition, the results of the WHO guided Solidarity trial, recently published in BMJ, could not reproduce these findings, as neither overall mortality nor severe courses of COVID-19 were decreased in patients receiving remdesivir (n=2570). The WHO Living Guidelines now refrains from recommending remdesivir as the primary treatment of COVID-19 in severely ill patients and states that further studies should be conducted regarding this issue [17] .\\nAlthough a number of case reports from Europe and China are showing heterogeneous results regarding the outcome of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] , a final conclusion that HIV-protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are inefficient in the treatment of COVID-189 cannot be drawn, as the limitations of these reports are quite clear: The reported outcomes refer to smaller, retrospective, and uncontrolled case series of only symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic cases may have been missed and [26, 34, [36] [37] [38] data were partially incomplete, such as information about the onset, duration, and intensity of symptoms [53] ; the plasma concentrations of TDF; or HIV-protease inhibitors, which might influence the efficacy of treatment against COVID-19. Furthermore, bacterial coinfections which were reported from a study in the USA [56] were a major reason for mortality in hospitalized patients with HIV and COVID-19. One study even reported a smaller proportion of patients with HIV and COVID-19 compared to the entire hospitalized population due to COVID-19 [57] . However, the data from NEAT indicate n=903 cases of reported HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in Europe until January 25, 2021, with a high rate of hospitalizations (n=374) and deaths (n=68, https://neat-id.knack.com/neat-id-COVID-19# home/). Taken the number of 85279 patients being treated in the reporting sites with an incidence of 1.06%, this corresponds to an incidence of 0.024% in the entire population of people living with HIV and AIDs in Europe (https://www.who.int/hiv/data/ en/), the incidence of SARS-CoV-2-positive tested subjects in Europe in the entire population is 0.4%. (https://de.statista. com/), and the prevalence of PLWH in Europe ranges from 0. 1% (e.g., Germany) up to 1.2% (Russia) (https://cfs.hivci.org/). Although reports in the NEAT database may be missing and we actually do not know the true rate of infections in people living with or without HIV and AIDS, the difference seems to be significant. There have been also reports from South Africa that \\nIn summary, it becomes quite clear that (1) the majority of all discussed trials are conducted as monotherapy studies, partially vs. placebo. (2) Only a small number of trials are evaluating dual combination regimens, in doing so testing also unusual or even contraindicated combinations (e.g., Darunavir/ Cobicistat/Hydroxychloroquin). (3) Currently, no triple/ multiple therapy regimens are evaluated in RTCs. (4) Ribavirin, the nucleoside analog with the highest binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is only part of two small trials. (5) Tenofovir/DF/AF, a nucleotide analog, which is available worldwide at a reasonable price as a generic drug, is evaluated in only two currently recruiting RCTs as part of COVID-19 therapy. (6) Lopinavir/ritonavir is only tested as monotherapy in seriously ill COVID-19 patients and in this case did not reveal sufficient efficacy [59] , as already seen in the past [27, 60] ; Lopinavir/ritonavir is not evaluated as part of a combination therapy [26] . Alternative approaches and up-to-date study designs which deploy the currently available medication in reasonable ways are scarce.\\n(A) There are no head-to-head studies of promising candidates, such as remdesivir vs. RBV vs. TDF/FTC vs.\\nFPV + X. TDF shows structural similarity to remdesivir, its binding energy to RNA polymerase is little less [10] and it is available worldwide as a generic drug, storage, and supply doesn't need cooling, application orally QD. The binding capacity of RBV is even higher than that of RDV and favipiravir already showed a comparable efficacy in smaller pilot studies.\\n(B) There are no double or triple combination studies, as established in the treatment of HBV, HCV, or HIV, e.g., RDV + X or TDF/FTC + X or TDF/FTC+LPV/r or Favipiravir + X, LPV/r + X. (C) There is only one study evaluating the repositioning of tenofovir in an outpatient setting as early antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2. More studies for the ambulant antiviral treatment are warranted as the capacities of hospital care are exhausted worldwide.\\nThe repurposing or repositioning of drugs for the new indication of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 treatment is more than reasonable. It can be the fastest way to treatment of COVID-19 and the embankment of the pandemic. But this approach needs international concerted policies regarding science, production, supply, and access of/to drugs. These are federal responsibilities, questions of independent science and marketing independent supply, and finally the general access to the best available treatment.\\nStudies should be conducted coordinated and have comparable study designs to allow meta-analyses. Smaller trials can provide a basis for the generation of new hypotheses or therapeutic approaches and should be very carefully appraised regarding their necessity, ethical, and scientific concerns. All of these cannot be committed to either the manufacturer's side or single academic research units. The final aim must be finding the most effective therapy in the shortest time, assuring worldwide access to treatment, independent from production capacities or market power.\\nRDV Remdesivir LPV/r Lopinavir/Ritonavir, RBV Ribavirin; RCT randomized controlled trial Trial/arm stopped, SOC standard of care, TAF tenofovir alafenamide, TDF tenofovir disoproxilfumarate, FTC emtricitabine, LPV/r lopinavir/ritonavir, RDV remdesivir, *Pre-Exposure trials non-therapeutic TDF tenofovir disoproxilfumarate, FTC emtricitabine, LPV/r lopinavir/ritonavir, RDV remdesivir, HCLQ hydroxychloroquine, NPI Nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitor (SARS-CoV-2), NRTI nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (HIV-1), PI protease inhibitor (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro or \\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Given that the COVID-19 pandemic shows important geographic variation in its prevalence and mortality, Delanghe et al (1) hypothesized that genetic variation of the host might, at least in part, explain the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They analyzed the geographic variation of a number of immune system-related human plasma protein polymorphisms and reported that the ACE1*D allele frequency correlated negatively with COVID-19 prevalence and positively with COVID-19-associated mortality. The other investigated polymorphisms, including the F and S alleles of complement C3, the C282Y mutation in homeostatic iron regulator HFE, the Hp1 and Hp2 alleles of haptoglobin, and the DBP1 and DBP2 alleles of vitamin D binding protein, did not significantly correlate with COVID-19 prevalence or mortality (2) .\\nAnother gene that shows significant geographic variation and that regulates various aspects of the adaptive immune response is chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). CCR5 is a receptor for proinflammatory chemokines that play key roles in host responses, especially to viruses. Furthermore, CCR5 expressed on various cell types plays a vital role in the inflammatory response by directing cells to sites of inflammation. The 32-bp deletion mutation in the CCR5 coding region (CCR5-Δ32) prevents receptor expression on the cell surface and leaves homozygous individuals without functional CCR5.\\nIt is well known that the CCR5-Δ32 mutation prevents HIV transmission and delays the onset of AIDS. In contrast to AIDS, homozygosity for the CCR5-Δ32 allele is a strong risk factor for symptomatic West Nile virus infection and correlates with severe tick-borne encephalitis virus symptoms. It has also been shown that CCR5-Δ32 patients are at higher risk than the general population for a fatal outcome in influenza infection, and that CCR5-knockout mice have an increased mortality rate after influenza virus infection (5, 6) .\\nThe CCR5-Δ32 mutation is highly prevalent in European populations, with an average frequency of 10%, and it shows a strong geographic north-to-south cline: the highest frequencies are in Nordic countries and the lowest in Southern European populations. The CCR5-Δ32 allele frequency in Croatia of 7% fits the observed European northto-south gradient (7).\\nThe variable prevalence of COVID-19 can be attributed to different factors (country's economic situation and levels of health services, number of diagnostics tests performed, comorbidities in a large number of fatal cases, differences in population density, demographic age distribution, environmental factors, etc), but an important factor underlying variable pandemic statistics is the influence of predisposing host genetics on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Therefore, we compared CCR5-Δ32 mutation frequency in 39 European countries (8) with the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19, as of June 1, 2020. Data from Albania, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine were included in the analysis. Data on the prevalence (number of cases/10 6 inhabitants), mortality (number of deaths/10 6 inhabitants), number of diagnostic tests per 10 6 people, and time elapsed since the onset of the epidemic (days since January 1, 2020) in each country were obtained from the Worldometer website (https:// www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries).\\nMultiple regression analyses revealed that the partial correlation coefficients of the CCR5-Δ32 mutation frequency showed no significant associations with the log prevalence (partial r = −0.004, P = 0.979) and log-mortality (partial r = −0.156, P = 0.355) of COVID-19, after adjusting for the log-number of diagnostic tests and log-onset of the epidemic (days) in each country as possible confounders.\\nOur findings did not show that the CCR5-Δ32 mutation can explain the variable prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 in European countries. Our research is limited to a welldefined area of Europe, where populations have a similar genetic background, where the frequency of CCR5-Δ32 mutation varies significantly, and where there are no major differences in other variables, such as biological, environmental, and social factors that could affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19, as compared with Asian and African countries.\\nOn the other hand, very recently it has been shown that critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with a CCR5 antagonist, leronlimab, experienced reversed hyperimmune activation and inflammation, as well as reversed immunosuppression, which thereby facilitated a more effective immune response correlated with decreases in blood SARS-CoV-2 levels (9). Accordingly, future studies of the effect of the CCR5-Δ32 mutation on the clinical course of COVID-19, as well as on the therapeutic responses of patients, are warranted.\\nIn conclusion, this is the first report on the role of the CCR5-Δ32 mutation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the CCR5-Δ32 mutation cannot be regarded as a predictor of COVID-19 prevalence or mortality in the European population. However, there are many other confounding genetic and environmental variables affecting the COVID-19 severity and even virulence of the virus that should be taken into account in further studies.\", \"As the spread of COVID-19 continues around the globe, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers involved with its response are constantly searching for reliable information on the virus. This presents those of us in information retrieval (IR) and text processing communities with a unique opportunity to contribute to the response to this pandemic by building infrastructure to improve search systems and to help identify answers for some of today's most pressing questions [8] . The task of TREC-COVID is for participants to retrieve the most relevant documents from the CORD-19 data-set for a given set of topics. To address this challenge, we implemented a system based on CAL, following the work of Grossman and Cormack in [3, 4] , using the tool kit provided as part of the Baseline Model Implementation (BMI), created by Roegiest and Cormack in [6] , and ourselves as the human assessors.\\nIn this section, we discuss prior research on CAL. We then discuss prior research on BMI, which provides the tool kits we heavily relied upon for this challenge.\\nContinuous Active Learning (CAL). CAL is a method for finding virtually all relevant information on a particular subject within a vast sea of electronically stored information (ESI): it repeatedly refines its understanding about which of the remaining documents are most likely to be of interest, based on the users' feedback regarding the documents already judged [4] . This protocol is most famously used in technologyassisted review (TAR) for electronic discovery in legal matters, achieving the best results reported in scientific literature to date [2] . Building on the CAL protocol, many implementations, such as BMI, have been highly successful at performing ad-hoc retrieval tasks, such as in the TREC 2015/2016 Total Recall Track [7, 5] and the TREC 2019 Decision Track [1] .\\nBaseline Model Implementation (BMI). BMI is an augmented version of CAL. It is autonomous and was initially made available to participants of the TREC 2015/2016 Total Recall Tracks [7, 5] , as well as the TREC 2019 Decision Track [1] to provide a baseline for comparison. However, BMI turned out to be highly competitive, with none of the manual participants achieving consistently superior results to this fully automated method [6] .\\nWhile BMI has been shown to generally outperform human-in-the-loop CAL implementations [6] , it requires labelled data, which was very limited, if available at all, for TREC-COVID; thus, we chose to insert a human back into the loop to make judgements. All other components, such as creating feature vectors, the learner, etc., were taken directly from the BMI tool kits.\\nDocument Set Processing. The document set used in the TREC-COVID Challenge is the COVID-19 Open Research Data-set (CORD-19). Our team opted to judge a document's relevancy using strictly the information available in the metadata file (year, authors, publisher, title, abstract) based on the work of Zhang et al. [9] which show that participants achieve higher recall using CAL when presented with only a single short excerpt rather than an entire document.\\nCAL. The following shows an outline of our specific implementation of CAL.\\n• STEP 1: Create a hypothetical relevant document, known as a synthetic document.\\nTo create the synthetic documents, we concatenated the query, question, and narrative components of the topics file provided by TREC-COVID, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 . • STEP 2: Use a machine-learning algorithm to suggest the next most-likely relevant document.\\nThe machine-learning algorithm we chose is Sofia-ML which Roegiest and Cormack used in their participation in the 2015 Total Recall Track [6] .\\n• STEP 3: Review the suggested documents and provide relevance feedback to the learning algorithm, indicating whether each suggested document is actually relevant or not.\\nTo do this, we sorted the results given by Sofia-ML in decreasing order of confidence, presenting the top most result to the human assessor using a text based user interface. The judgement made by our human assessors is one of {0-not relevant, 1-partially relevant, 2-relevant}. This corresponds to the annotations made by biomedical experts as part of TREC-COVID following each round. As Sofia-ML does not distinguish between relevant judgements and partially relevant judgments, both were designated to be relevant in training.\\n• STEP 4: Repeat Step 2 and 3 until very few, if any, of the suggested documents are relevant.\\nUsing the same stopping condition as in [5] , we aimed to stop when the following criterion was met:\\nwhere m is the number of relevant documents reviewed, n is the number of irrelevant documents reviewed, a is a constant which determines how many non-relevant documents are to be reviewed in the course of finding each relevant document, and b is a constant which represents a fixed overhead for the number of irrelevant documents that must be reviewed.\\nS-CAL. One of the major drawbacks of the CAL method outlined above is the impractical number of documents that must be reviewed when the number of relevant documents is large. Scalable Continuous Active Learning (S-CAL) [3] addresses this issue by 1. Segmenting the corpus into batches and allowing assessors to label only a small finite sample of documents from each successive batch.\\n2. Temporarily augmenting each training set by adding a set of 100 random documents from the corpus -which is, with high probability, not relevant for a large corpus -labelled not relevant.\\nHowever, the stopping condition for S-CAL outlined in [3] is still infeasible to achieve with CORD-19 and our team size; thus, we exchange the initial dynamic stopping condition for a static goal of assessing 300 documents per topic.\\nHyper-parameter Tuning. Given the availability of labelled data after the first round, we performed hyper-parameter tuning on both the loop type and the lambda value to better fit CORD-19. Finding no significant differences in our tests, we decided to continue with our initial values taken from [6] , which were decided upon discussion with the author of Sofia-ML as well as their internal experiments.\\nCreating Runs. To generate the results for our runs, we created lists of 1000 documents ordered as shown in Figure 3 . Key-Term Highlighting. Key-term highlighting is a feature commonly provided by IR systems, such as Google, to assist human readers in processing information. Following the online sample of CAL, as show in Figure 4 , given as a supplement to [4] , we chose to highlight the top five highest-scoring words from a document, according to Sofia-ML, in our UI for assessors, as show in Figure 5 . Table 1 shows the specifications of our system for each round of TREC-COVID and Table 2 shows our results. From these, we are able to make some interesting observations:\\n1. Despite our human assessors having provided more labelled documents in round 2 than round 1, our performance decreased. One possible explanation could be that, through the use of the key-term highlighting feature, our human assessor(s) exchanged quantity for quality resulting in an overall poorer model.\\nDespite being able to provide more labelled documents in round 5 than 4, our performance once again decreased. One possible explanation could be that we did not perform the necessary quality control required for additional human assessors -once again, exchanging quantity for quality labels, resulting in an overall poorer performance.\\n3. The runs ordered by method Figure 3 (iii) consistently outperformed our other runs. This could imply that the documents judged to be not-relevant by our assessors are still more relevant than Sofia-ML's labelling of unseen documents.\\nIn this paper, we report on our participation to the TREC 2020 COVID Track rounds 1 though 5, describing our approach, results, and lessons learned. We initially use CAL [4] , implemented using tools from BMI's feature kit [6] , with ourselves as the annotators. The large human labelling effort required for our system motivated us to implement a key-term highlighting feature, use S-CAL [3] , and recruit more human assessors.

Several data regarding the effects of the COVID-19 state of emergency or lockdown on physical activity levels have been presented worldwide. 1, 2 For instance, a worldwide decrease in step counts has been reported post-COVID- 19 . 3 Countries that implemented lockdowns, such as the UK and France, have had relatively high COVID-19 infection rates and showed rapidly decreasing step counts. In contrast, although countries that did not implement lockdowns, such as Japan and Taiwan, have had relatively low COVID-19 infection rates, overall step counts have decreased in June 2020. These direct and indirect effects might be strong in older adults. Among Japanese older adults aged ≥65 years, total physical activity time per week decreased by 65 min (−26.5%) from January to April 2020. 4 Physical activity in older adults has great impacts on future health conditions. It decreases mortality, delays the onset of dementia, prevents frailty and leads to improved self-rated health. [5] [6] [7] [8] In older adults, good exercise habits could be especially important for decreasing the risk of disability onset and lowering mortality. 9 Lifestyle before the COVID-19 pandemic and lifestyle changes during the state of emergency might affect perceived health status, which usually negatively affects future health conditions among older adults. 10 In particular, old-old adults will be easily affected by activity limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Crosssectional and longitudinal associations between older adults\\' selfrated health (e.g. perceptions of physical and cognitive health status) and corresponding objective functions have been reported. 11, 12 In addition, activities including physical exercise and cognitive stimulation (e.g. using a computer) seem to determine perceived positive fitness changes in older adults. 13 Older adults with advancing age might have a greater risk of perceived poor health status on adverse events. Thus, changes in perceived physical and cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 pandemic could implicate future health status among old-old adults.\\nIt is unknown how many old-old adults have perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined the associations of participation in an exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic and the exercise habits and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the state of emergency with perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness among community-dwelling old-old adults.\\nWe carried out a mail survey of community-dwelling older adults living in Bibai, Hokkaido, Japan. The flow chart of participants is presented in Figure 1 . In this study, we mailed a paper-based questionnaire to 1112 older adults who had participated in a health check program for older adults aged ≥75 years in 2018. Of those 1112 old-old adults, 889 responded to this survey. Individuals with a history of stroke, dementia and Parkinson\\'s disease were excluded. Respondents who had missing values for medical history, and perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness were also excluded. Finally, data from 774 respondents were analyzed (Fig. 1 ).\\nA self-administered questionnaire was mailed to eligible participants. The survey was carried out in July 2020 after obtaining approval to survey Bibai City, Hokkaido. Bibai city is a rural area that in 2020 had a population of 20 839 and an aging rate of 42.5%. Since the first case of infection was confirmed in Hokkaido on 28 January 2020, the infection has widely spread in the area. On 28 February 2020, the governor of Hokkaido declared a state of emergency to control the spread of the infection and avoid a health system collapse. The state of emergency continued until 19 March, requesting that people refrain from going out on weekends, and that they avoid crowded places, close-range conversations and poorly ventilated spaces when going out. The present study was carried out with the approval of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University (No. 200065). Informed consent was obtained from all participants before their inclusion in the study, and sufficient ethical considerations were given based on the Declaration of Helsinki.\\nThe questionnaire asked about personal characteristics (i.e. age, sex, whether a participant lived alone or with others), medical history and polypharmacy (≥5 drugs). Polypharmacy was defined as the use of at least five drugs. 14 The five-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-5) was used to assess depressive symptoms. The GDS-5 consists of five items, and has a \"yes/no\" response format with a two-point rating scale (0 or 1) and a final score ranging from 0-5 points. 15 Higher scores in the GDS-5 (scores of ≥2) indicate depressive symptoms. 16 We investigated the participants\\' perceived decline in physical and cognitive fitness. Participants were asked to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the following questions: (i) \"Do you perceive a decline in physical fitness after the state of emergency?\"; and (ii) \"Do you perceive a decline in cognitive fitness after the state of emergency?\" Participants who answered \"yes\" to these questions were classified as perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness.\\nParticipants were also asked about their participation status before the declaration of the state of emergency in the community-based self-management exercise class, which consisted mainly of muscle strength training. They chose an answer among the following three choices: (i) continuously attended classes before the state of emergency declaration; (ii) attended, but not continuously; and (iii) never attended. We surveyed the habit of exercising at least twice a week for >30 min and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the state of emergency. Participants were asked to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the following questions: (i) \"Did you have any exercise habits that you continued during the state of emergency, more than twice a week, more than 30 min?\"; and (ii) \"Did you have any disruption to your daily life during the state of emergency?\"\\nParticipants\\' characteristics are described using mean AE SD and count (%), as appropriate. The differences between individuals who perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness and those who did not were examined using the t-test or χ 2 -test, as appropriate. Effect size (ES) was estimated using Cohen\\'s d or Cramér\\'s V to assess the degree of difference. Logistic regression models were carried out with the perception of declining physical and cognitive fitness as the dependent variable. The independent variables were participation in a community-based self-management exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic, exercise habits and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Potential covariates included age, sex, living alone, medical history (i.e. hypertension, heart disease and diabetes mellitus), polypharmacy (≥5 drugs) and depressive symptoms (GDS-5 ≥2).\\nOf the 774 respondents who satisfied the inclusion criteria, 339 (43.8%) participants reported a decline in physical fitness, 259 (33.5%) perceived declining cognitive fitness, and 220 (28.4%) perceived declines in both physical and cognitive fitness during the state of emergency. Comparisons of characteristics between old-old people with perceived declining physical or cognitive fitness during the state of emergency and those without are presented in Table 1 .\\n© 2021 Japan Geriatrics Society\\nUnivariate analyses using the t-test or χ 2 -test showed that participants with a perception of declining physical fitness were older, more likely to be women, and had higher rates of heart disease and polypharmacy compared with those without this perception. The perception of declining physical fitness was also associated with a higher rate of participation in a community-based self-management exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic (ES = 0.085, P = 0.020), a lower rate of physical exercise (ES = 0.145, P < 0.001) and a higher rate of disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency (ES = 0.232, P < 0.001). Old-old adults with perceptions of declining cognitive fitness were older, and had higher rates of participation in a community-based self-management exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic (ES = 0.086, P = 0.018) and higher rate of disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the state of emergency (ES = 0.172, P < 0.001).\\nAssociations between participation in a community-based selfmanagement exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic and a perception of declining physical and cognitive fitness were observed in the crude model of the logistic regression analysis, but not in an adjusted model for age, sex, living alone, medical history (i.e. hypertension, heart disease and diabetes mellitus), polypharmacy (≥5 drugs), depressive symptoms (GDS-5 ≥2), exercise habits and disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the COVID-19 state of emergency. In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, exercise habits during the state of emergency were significantly associated with a lower perception of declining physical fitness (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.86; P = 0.007). Disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the state of emergency was significantly associated with a higher perception of declining physical (OR 3.42, 95% CI 2.03-5.76; P < 0.001) and cognitive fitness (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.29-3.49; P = 0.003) ( Table 2 ).\\nThe present study examined perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness during the state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in community-dwelling old-old adults. Approximately half and more than one-third of communitydwelling old-old adults perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness, respectively. In addition, approximately 30% of participants perceived declines in both physical and cognitive fitness during the state of emergency. Lower rates of exercise during the state of emergency were associated with perceived declining physical fitness, and disruption to the rhythms of life during the state of emergency was associated with perceived declines in both physical and cognitive fitness.\\nIn a Japanese government policy for health promotion among older people, community-dwelling older adults are provided opportunities to promote social interactions with other community members in so-called \"community salons\". 17 These activities including social participations were confirmed to decrease the risk of disability onset. 18 Furthermore, community-based selfmanagement groups are effective in preventing new long-term care service requirement certification. 19 However, we were forced to discontinue these activities in the community due to the COVID-19 state of emergency. Contrary to expectations, the present study indicated that old-old adults who had participated in the exercise class before the COVID-19 pandemic showed a tendency for higher perception of declining physical and cognitive fitness during the state of emergency compared with those who did not participate. The loss of opportunities to exercise in community-based self-management groups might lead to a sudden and unexpected increase in the perception of poor health status.\\nDecreasing physical activity trends likely reflects a combination of changes to physical activity (e.g. walking and exercising) and activities of daily living (e.g. commuting and shopping) due to social distancing efforts. In the present study, 36.8% of community-dwelling old-old adults had exercise habits, exercising at least twice a week for >30 min at a time during the declaration of an emergency. A previous Japanese national survey showed that 40.3% of people aged ≥75 years had exercise habits, exercising at least twice a week for >30 min for >1 year. 20 In the present study, \\n| © 2021 Japan Geriatrics Society although many respondents might be considered health conscious, approximately one-third of community-dwelling old-old adults showed exercise behaviour during the state of emergency. Several studies showed that physical activity (especially exercise habits) was related to mental health in older adults. 21 Several mechanisms manifesting at psychological (e.g. mood, feelings of mastery, self-efficacy) and neurophysiological (e.g. hippocampal neurogenesis, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis regulation) levels would contribute to mental health, such as by reducing depression and anxiety. 22 A recent study showed that PA levels were related to mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety, in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. 23 In particular, older adults who regularly engaged in vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PA meeting the World Health Organization\\'s global recommendations for health during the quarantine reported lower depressive symptoms. 23 The intensity and frequency of exercise and physical activity could be important factors that influence health. Moderate-intensity physical activity is recommended to improve or maintain physical and mental health among older adults, 24 but effects on physical and mental health from light-intensity physical activity have also been reported in older adults. 25 In the current study, measurements of physical activity levels and continued exercise habits could be lacking. In addition, the intensity and frequency of exercise were unclear. An adequate instrument (e.g. the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) should be considered in future studies.\\nIn contrast, 14% of respondents reported disruption to the rhythms of daily life during the state of emergency. The maintenance of daily routines, such as sleep behaviour, activities of daily living, taking three meals a day and leisure activities, could improve the health status of old-old adults. For example, sleep disturbance in older adults is associated with poor health, such as depression and limitations in activities of daily living. 26 Exposure to artificial light at night has a negative impact on metabolic health. 27 Additionally, meal skipping lowers energy and nutrient intake. 28 Therefore, lifestyle habits, exercise habits and daily life rhythms during the COVID-19 state of emergency would be associated with the maintenance of health status in old-old adults.\\nWe consider that self-perceived physical and cognitive fitness might be a good indicator to assess functional health among older adults. Previous studies have suggested that a self-reported measure of physical fitness was moderately correlated to objectively measured physical fitness in healthy older adults. 29 Furthermore, older adults\\' subjective perceptions of a decline in cognition predicted future mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 30 However, we applied simpler questions to assess self-perceived physical and cognitive fitness during the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Validation is required to confirm this approach.\\nAlthough the present findings provide additional knowledge regarding the effects of the COVID-19 state of emergency on perceived health status and preventive behaviour factors, several limitations should be noted. COVID-19 state-of-emergency data differ by region, and the effects might differ depending on the epidemic situation. This study was carried out in a specific city located in Hokkaido, Japan. The COVID-19 pandemic is without precedent worldwide, and the situation changes day-by-day. In such a socially disorienting situation, self-reported answers might differ depending on the time of data collection. Additionally, the study sample was not randomly selected. Although participants with dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and a history of stroke were excluded, additional exclusionary criteria might be required, such as a history of diabetes, and cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric diseases. There was a relatively high response rate (79.9%); however, non-responders (n = 223; mean age 84.0 AE 4.4 years) were older than responders (mean age 83.3 AE 4.4 years; P = 0.020). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women between responders (55.7%) and non-responders (60.5%; P = 0.191). In addition, the current study sample included old-old adults who had participated in a health check program in 2018, but the characteristics of participants versus non-participants in the 2018 health checkup were not compared. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the current findings to other areas and situations. Finally, causal relationships should be reconsidered, as this was a transversal study.\\nIn conclusion, approximately half and more than one-third of community-dwelling old-old adults perceived declining physical and cognitive fitness, respectively, during the state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the state of emergency, exercise habits were positively correlated with perceived health status among community-dwelling old-old adults, whereas disruption to the rhythms of daily life was negatively correlated. \\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.', 'The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic presents a great challenge to global health and has claimed millions of lives worldwide. Moreover, until herd immunity is successfully induced in a large population throughout the world, SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to become endemic, leading to further loss of life. In response, multiple vaccine candidates based on RNA and DNA technologies, inactivated viruses, and other approaches have been rapidly developed 1-3 . Especially in the United States, two messenger RNA 19, 20 . Neutralization assays [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] have been developed to quantify antibodies directly responsible for neutralizing viruses, and a strong correlation between neutralizing antibody titers with antibody levels against spike protein/RBD in COVID-19 patients has been reported 20,26-34 . In addition, antibody avidity measures the strength of antibody binding to viral antigens, shedding light on antibody maturation, and is potentially useful for assessing vaccine efficacy [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Therefore, it is important to measure both IgG levels and avidity to assess not only antibody quantity but also viral antigen binding ability post-infection or post-vaccination over time. On the other hand, reliable and inexpensive tests could be implemented in hospitals, clinics, various point-of-care (POC) sites, and even at home for frontline qualitative antibody detection to assess immune responses to COVID-19 infection or vaccination.\\nThe primary objectives of this study were to longitudinally assess the immune responses to the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines by measuring anti-RBD IgG antibody levels and IgG avidity using the pGOLD™ assay. We also compared antibody production between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and the relation to severity of post-vaccination reactions. We reported the results of longitudinal POC rapid testing of antibodies post-vaccination using the FDA EUA MidaSpot™ Antibody Combo Detection Kit 41 . Finally, for comparison we determined anti-RBD IgG and anti-NCP antibody levels in a cohort of healthy volunteers from the pre-pandemic era and from patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\\nBetween January and May 2021, a total of 71 adults vaccinated with Pfizer (n = 54) and Moderna (n = 17) were recruited for this study including Caucasians (63.4%), Asians (29.6%), and African Americans (7.0%), with a mean age of 46.8 ± 13.1 years. The common comorbidities reported were hypertension (16.9%), hyperlipidemia (8.5%), autoimmune type disorders (4.2%), and diabetes (1.4%) (Supplementary Table S1 ).\\nPost-vaccination local reaction and systemic events are included in Table 1 . Myalgia, malaise, headaches, and fever were the most common symptoms, with increased frequency and severity after the second dose. After the first and second doses, respectively, 44% and 27% of subjects reported mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site. 60% of participants experienced mild-tomoderate systemic symptoms. Compared to participants who received the Pfizer vaccine, those who received the Moderna vaccine exhibited higher symptom frequency (78% vs. 55%) and severity for the 1 st and 2 nd vaccine dose (Figure 4c ).

Symptoms generally peaked at two days after vaccination and resolved within a week. No subjects experienced recurring symptoms or contracted COVID-19 after the second dose.\\nTo investigate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, we measured pre-first dose (day 0) and vaccine-elicited anti-RBD IgG antibodies at various times post-vaccination in 71 vaccinees between 19 and 146 days following the first vaccine dose. Based on the days from first-dose injection, vaccinated samples were divided into five groups: D0 (0 days, prior to first Rapid testing was performed as a preliminary qualitative detection of antibodies elicited by vaccination with a 10 μL fingerstick sample, meanwhile a 10 μL DBS sample was saved for quantitative pGOLD™ assay. The POC MidaSpot™ lateral flow assay detected anti-RBD IgG in ~ 90% of vaccinees after the first dose (Table 2, Figure 1 ) and 100% positive rate in fully vaccinated individuals at day 33-55 for both the Moderna and Pfizer cohorts. With ~ 10% vaccinees, MidaSpot detected low or negative IgG signals after the first dose but detected clear IgG lines after the second dose (Figure 1a, 1c) . The negative agreement is 100% for both vaccines in the pre-vaccination group (Table 2) .\\nUsing the pGOLD™ assay, we detected anti-RBD IgG with a 100% positive rate for all vaccinees at all the post-first dose timepoints (D19-28, D33-55, D61-83, D89-108, and D112-146), and a 100% negative rate in the pre-vaccination group (D0), as well as pre-pandemic samples. Since the mRNA vaccines encode the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the pGOLD™ assay only detected positive anti-RBD for the vaccinees without detecting anti-NCP IgG (Figure 2a, 2c, 2d), compared to both positive anti-RBD and anti-NCP detected in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 2b, 2e, 2f) . It was also observed that there was a clear increase in baseline signals for anti-NCP IgG after the D33-55 timepoint, but still below the cutoff value of 10.3 ( Figure 2d ).\\nHowever, the reason is unknown.\\n.

The anti-RBD antibodies evolved from a low baseline level (D0), upward to mildly positive (D19-28), rapidly peaking (D33-55), and then gradually decreasing (D61-83, D89-108, D112-146) (Figure 2c ). Each group\\'s general data information is summarized in Supplementary Table S2 . The normality test by the Shapiro-Wilk method showed that the anti-RBD IgG levels grouped by time points were non-normal for D0, D19-28, D33-55, D61-83, and D112-146, and normal for D89-108 (Supplemental Table S3 ). It is to be noted that the D89-108 timepoint only had 15 samples. We then used a nonparametric statistical analysis method, the Mann-Whitney test (Supplementary Table S4 Table S4 ). The anti-RBD IgG levels measured at 19-28 days (D19-28 group), before the second dose, were significantly lower than the later groups (D33-55, D61-83, D89-108, and D112-146) with p value < 0.0001, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 Table S4 ).\\nA SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG avidity assay was developed on Nirmidas\\' pGOLD™ platform to investigate antibody-antigen binding strength and stability under denaturing conditions. In the pGOLD™ anti-RBD IgG avidity test, a 4 M urea-containing sample buffer and urea-free normal sample buffer were employed to dilute the same sample solution derived from a vaccinee\\'s DBS, then loaded into neighboring wells on pGOLD™ biochips for detecting anti-RBD IgG with and without urea treatment (Figure 3a) . A higher avidity index (the ratio of IgG level with urea .

On the other hand, 5.4% of the Pfizer vaccinees turned negative by rapid test greater than three months after the first dose. Close comparison with quantitative pGOLD™ antibody data showed that the anti-RBD levels in these \\'negative\\' samples were still above the cutoff value relative to the pre-vaccination level but were indeed close to the minimum levels of the corresponding groups of the cohort, and at least three-fold lower than the median levels .

Importantly, there has been accumulating evidence that anti-spike/RBD IgG levels are strongly correlated with neutralizing activity in COVID-19 patients 26-30 and vaccinated individuals 44 . It is reasonable that anti-RBD IgG levels are measured to assess neutralizing antibody levels, which could be done quantitatively in many laboratories or qualitatively at POC sites. In this study, we focused on measuring anti-RBD IgG levels and anti-RBD IgG avidity to investigate the kinetics and maturation of vaccine-elicited antibodies.\\nOne of our findings was that both the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines elicited anti-RBD IgG effectively in 100% of the 71 vaccinees studied longitudinally. The average IgG levels were boosted by the second dose and peaked after ~ two weeks. Antibody levels then showed a downward trend up to the four-month timepoint. These observations were similar to recent reports on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines 5,15,45 . Comparing these two cohorts side-by-side .

However, at the four-month timepoint, anti-RBD IgG levels in the Moderna and Pfizer cohorts were closer, suggesting potentially similar long-term effects and vaccine efficacy.\\nThe antibody avidity index provides an assessment of antibody-antigen binding strength by measuring antibodies specifically bound to antigens in the presence of a denaturing agent. It is known that the antibodies produced in the early days of an infection show low avidity with weak binding to the viral antigen. Avidity increases as antibodies mature over months or years through processes including colonial expansion, hypermutation, and affinity selection in the germinal center 46 . Antibody avidity has been used to assess recent vs. remote infections 18,35-39 and to analyze vaccination efficacy, immunity, and the success of convalescent plasma-based antibody therapy [47] [48] [49] .\\nOverall, the average avidity index of the two mRNA vaccines showed an increasing trend over the four months period monitored ( Figure 3b ). Consistent with a stronger immune response, the average anti-RBD IgG avidity for the Moderna cohort was higher than that of the Pfizer cohort but did not show an obvious upward trend in the 4-month period. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG in the Pfizer cohort showed a steady increase approaching that of the Moderna cohort, suggesting a clear antibody maturation process. In the four-month post-vaccination timepoint (Figure 4a, 4b) , the two mRNA vaccines were associated with similar antibody levels and avidity (slightly higher for Moderna), consistent with the similar ~ 95-98% efficacy (also slightly higher for Moderna) in protection from COVID-19 infection from clinical trials.\\nBoth antibody concentration/quantity and antigen binding strength/avidity are important to immunity and can be used to analyze vaccine effectiveness. As antibody concentration wanes over time post-vaccination, a higher avidity could be important to sustain immunity and maintain the ability to fight viral infection at reduced antibody levels. We clearly observed increasing anti-RBD avidity and maturation with the Pfizer vaccinee cohort (Figure 4b ), a welcoming result since even though the antibody concentration decreased over time, the viral-antigen binding strength increased for the remaining antibodies. The Moderna vaccinee cohort showed high antibody levels and avidity in the first 4 months period with more severe side-effects, without an obvious increase in avidity. The differences between the two mRNA vaccines were interesting .

Clearly, it is important to continue monitoring the two cohorts over longer periods of time to investigate further evolutions of antibody levels and avidity and their relations to immunity. It is possible that antibody maturation continues to further boost avidity and afford useful viral fighting capabilities even at low antibody levels.\\nWe observed that women and subjects < 50 years of age tended to exhibit a better immune response, and subjects with a history of autoimmunity had a lower immune response. By oneway ANOVA analysis, we analyzed subjects that were ≤ 50 years and > 50 years of age. Anti-RBD IgG was significantly higher at the three-to four-months measurement point (75.5±49.2 vs. 48 .5±34.0, p=0.047). We analyzed subjects who had autoimmunity (n = 4) and found that the anti-RBD IgG levels were significantly lower at the three-to four-months point compared to the rest of the group (n = 40) (75.5±49.2 vs 48.5±34.0, p=0.045).\\nWe performed the MidaSpot™ POC rapid antibody test as an initial qualitative assessment of immune response to vaccination, during which dried blood spots were collected for quantitative pGOLD™ assay. The results also shed light on whether rapid antibody tests could be used to produce meaningful frontline assessment of antibody levels elicited by the vaccines at POC sites.\\nImportantly, the FDA EUA MidaSpot™ rapid antibody test detected anti-RBD IgG with 100% sensitivity in fully mRNA vaccinated subjects (~ two weeks after the second dose). For the Moderna vaccinees, 100% antibody positivity persisted to the ~ four-month timepoint, with ~ 94% positivity for the Pfizer cohort. Importantly, the 5.4% negative results were from the threeto four-month timepoints, for vaccinees whose quantitative anti-RBD levels measured by pGOLD™ were close to minimum levels of the corresponding groups of the cohort, and at least three-fold lower than the median values (Table 2, Supplementary Table S5 ). We conclude that the MidaSpot™ rapid test can indeed provide a useful qualitative, preliminary assessment of immune response to vaccination. For subjects whose MidaSpot™ rapid test anti-RBD result turned negative or very faint in the signal line, the corresponding quantitative antibody level was low and warranted further testing or clinical decisions.\\nThe pGOLD™ assay is a novel nanotechnology assay platform capable of quantifying antibody levels and binding affinity to viruses 18,39,50-52 . It is also capable of detecting antibodies in DBS or saliva samples and could offer a non-invasive approach to assess antibody response to vaccination. Furthermore, the combination of the MidaSpot™ rapid antibody test and the .

The 4-months post-vaccination results are presented here as an interim report, and the study will continue up to more than a year. Thus far, both vaccines elicit similar levels of anti-RBD IgG and avidity at the 4-month timepoint, suggesting that both vaccines are similarly efficient at protecting vaccinated populations. We compared the two mRNA vaccinee groups and observed interesting differences, and the results might shed light on vaccine development. An ideal vaccine would be one that generates not only high antibody levels, but also high viral-antigen binding strength, and at the same time affords well-tolerated side effect severity. With the vaccinees, we observed that in general, although antibody levels decreased over time, antibody maturation was observed with increased antigen binding strength, boding well for sustained immunity. We did observe highly variable immune responses including those with well below average anti-RBD IgG levels and avidity. It is therefore important to monitor immune responses at the individualized and personalized level, identify those who are still at risk even after vaccination, and provide meaningful measures to protect them from infections.\\n.

After a brief centrifugation, the DBS-dissolved sample solution was heated for 30 minutes at 56 º C. The heat-inactivated solution was used for the pGOLD™ assay immediately or stored at 4 º C for later use.\\nThe pGOLD™ antibody assays were performed in a 64-well format in the following steps. 1)\\nBlocking: All wells were blocked with a blocking buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1X PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature; 2) Sample incubation: each well was then incubated with 100 µL of 2X diluted dissolved DBS sample solution in 10% FBST (10% FBS including 0.05% Tween 20) for 60 minutes at room temperature. A mixture of diluted anti-RBD IgG/IgM purified antibodies as signal normalizer was loaded into the neighboring well on the same row as each sample tested, and a blank control (10% FBST only) was included on each biochip; 3) Secondary antibody incubation: each well was subsequently incubated with a mixture of 4 nM iFluor TM 820-labeled anti-human IgG secondary antibody, 4 nM CF647-labeled antihuman IgM secondary antibody, and 4 nM iFluor TM 820-labeled streptavidin in a 2% BSA solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. Each well was washed six times with 1X PBST (10X PBST: 10X PBS with 0.5% Tween 20) between steps. The iFluor TM 820-labeled streptavidin in the detection step binds to BSA-biotin spots in each well on the pGOLD™ biochip, and the signal was used as an \"intrawell signal normalizer\". In parallel, row-dependent, antigen-specific \"adjacent well\" normalization was performed to normalize antigen printing variation or slide-to-slide variation. Anti-RBD IgG/IgM levels were calculated as the ratio of anti-RBD signal of the sample to that of the adjacent well normalizer and multiplied by 100.\\nAnti-NCP IgG levels were calculated as the ratio of anti-NCP signal of the sample to that of the intrawell normalizer (BSA-Biotin) multiplied by 100.\\n.

The two solutions were run side-by-side in neighboring pGOLD™ wells, under the otherwise identical pGOLD™\\nprotocol. An avidity index was calculated as the ratio of IgG signal detected in the solution with 4 M urea to that without urea 53 . Avidity is always below the value of 1, since the denaturing urea tends to weaken antibody binding to antigens immobilized on pGOLD™. A higher avidity index corresponds to higher antibody-antigen binding strength. \\nContinuous values were shown as mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed data and median and interquartile range (IQR) for nonparametric data.

FCAs can help students 275 limit the overall number of applications by considering other aspects of their planned career 276 paths in selecting programs at which to apply. For example, students interested in a non-277 academic career may consider community hospital programs over academic medical center 278 programs, while students planning to subspecialize may wish to apply to programs with 279 are certain they will not stay for residency. 281\\nIn determining the number of applications, the AAMC \"point of diminishing returns\" 282 tool (PDR) uses Step 1 scores to predict the number of programs needed to apply to match 283 successfully. 14 In OBGYN, applicants with a score >=230 needed to apply to 14 programs 284 (confidence interval, 13-15) to reach the highest likelihood of matching successfully: adding 285 more applications did not increase the chances of a successful match. For scores 214-229, the 286 PDR was 21 programs (CI, 19-23), with an 82% likelihood of matching. For scores < 213, the PDR 287 was 28 programs (CI, 26-30) with a 76% likelihood of matching. Approximately 90% of OBGYN 288 applicants ranking >=10 programs matched; over 99% of applicants ranking >=20 programs 289 matched. 14 Because of the decreased expenses associated with virtual interviews, students 290 may consider over-applying during the 2020 application cycle.

Students should not 310 falsely promise to rank a program first but may wish to inform a program of specific reasons 311 they are ranking a program first, such as a spouse at the same institution. Communication from 312 a program does not necessarily indicate a student will be ranked highly.

Students should rank 318 programs in their preferred order. By ranking a program, the student is agreeing to 319 employment at that program. Students should not rank a program they do not wish to attend. 320\\nThe NRMP recommends submitting the list before the deadline, as internet or website failures 321 have occurred. 61 322\\nFCAs should understand the special concerns of couples matching, described in detail at 325 the NRMP website (http://www.nrmp.org/couples-in-the-match/ ). For couples, each student 326 must rank the same number of programs or options, up to a total of 300 combinations of 327 residency programs , including \"no match\" options. 61 The couple will match to the most 328 preferred pair of programs on the rank order lists where each partner has been offered a 329 position (or a \"no match\" option is listed). A frank appraisal of each student\\'s competitiveness 330 in their specialty is essential to ensuring the best match for both students.

', \"Each year, millions of people are exposed to serious health risks due to emerging infectious and communicable diseases. This poses a severe threat to the public health security at local, regional or national level; especially in underdeveloped countries. This is primarily due to the lack of infrastructure for timely collection, reporting, and analysis of epidemic data; non-existent early warning and forecasting systems; inadequate preparedness and emergency response management [22] .\\n3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with estimated 96 million cases annually. The worldwide incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold in the past 30 years. Pakistan is among the 110 countries in the world which are badly affected by the mosquito-borne dengue virus. The first outbreak of dengue fever (DF) in Pakistan was confirmed in 1994. The country is currently experiencing among worst-ever dengue outbreaks, recording about 45,000 confirmed cases [27] . Even today, an effective dengue vaccine offering balanced protection is still elusive. Unfortunately, existing dengue vaccines are known to have limited efficacy and cure [8] . This underscores the critical need of preventing dengue transmission and eventual outbreak by: (i) investigating favorable conditions for the dengue epidemic to occur [21] ; (ii) plummeting the vector population [23] ; and averting the vector-human contact [7] , all of which are perceived as daunting challenges of Epidemiology. Due to the lack of ICT enabled governance, the existing infectious disease surveillance systems in Pakistan are unable to perform epidemiological spread analyses and effective emergency response planning [11, 18] . Researchers have started exploring latest techniques like Artificial Intelligence for diagnostic screen of dengue suspects [12] , but these methods are still in their infancy.\\nTo mitigate these challenges, we need to develop a reliable health surveillance and rapid emergency response infrastructure, that monitors and responds to known endemic diseases in the country, and evolves to cater potential new outbreaks. This infrastructure should have the capability to collect spatio-temporal epidemiological data, analyze it using computational methods, forecast possible outbreaks and generate early warnings for rapid emergency response management. Due to the sparsity of data, the dynamics of the vector population and its interaction with the human population is quite difficult to capture. We therefore need to build models that incorporate the vector population, disease transmission and the spread direction of the infectious disease, and that support the application of preemptive strategies and countermeasures.\\nIn this study we present a simulation approach to analyze and predict the mosquito population density and its consequence on dengue spread. We also simulate the pathogen transmission, and observe the dynamic interaction of human and mosquito population, both of which we use to forecast outbreaks in a spatial environment. Our proposed agent-based simulation framework allows modeling of both human and vector population dynamics, using separate layers. Human agents evolve between different states, from Susceptible to Exposed, Infected and eventually Recovered states while Mosquito agents evolve from Egg to Larva, Pupa and Adult state. Both population layers are spatially distributed and we model the interaction between both layers using our proposed algorithm. In addition, we expose both layers to exogenous variables such a temperature, humidity, rainfall and the permeable water surfaces in the region. From our simulation results we can reproduce predicted dengue cases across age groups and highlight them using spatio-temporal visualizations. We validate our results using data of an existing study of the local region [4] . Our proposed framework can be re-used for simulation, visualization and forecasting of any region and aid Public health departments in emergency preparedness.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the background concepts used in this paper and the literature review. Section 3 discusses our proposed framework. Section 4 provides simulation results and model validation and Sect. 5 provides conclusions and future work.\\nThis section provides key concepts used in our modeling approach. Epidemiology is the study of models, causes, effects, risk factors, transmission, spread and outbreaks of infectious diseases in a particular population [25] . DENV is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Aedes mosquitoes primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. A susceptible mosquito can acquire infection from an infectious person and transmit it further, or human gets infection from the bite of already Infectious Aedes aegypti. It spends its lives around or in side houses, becomes adult and typically flies up to 400 m [26] . Adees aegypti life cycle is composed of four stages as shown in Fig. 2 . Aedes Aygepti proliferates around 30-32 • C. The number of eggs laid per batch depends on the weight of mosquito and other factors. Details of the dengue epidemiology can be viewed at [9] . \\nVarious meteorological factors also influence the growth of the vector population and the spread of dengue fever. Temperature and humidity influence the incidence of dengue fever by modifying adult feeding behavior, larval development and mosquito survival. The average life span of Aedes mosquito is 25 days, with a range from one day to 76 days. Population density of Aedes Aegypti rapidly increases in summers as rising temperatures shortens the incubation period of mosquitoes and they take less time to emerge from eggs to adults. This increase the overall risk of dengue transmission [14] . The mortality rate of mosquitoes increases at high temperatures. For temperatures 15 • C, the feeding frequency of mosquitoes increases resulting in greater risk of viral transmission. Mosquito life cycle consists of two stages one of which is aquatic i.e they require stagnant water in order to develop and reproduce. Rainfall plays a vital role in the development of mosquitoes and Dengue transmission. There is an increase in dengue cases during and after rainy seasons. Pakistan is unfortunately experiencing severe forms of above stated changes. Relative humidity, temperature and rain remained noteworthy prognosticators of dengue occurrence in Pakistan. Surge of cases occurred from September to October [24] , as shown in Fig. 3 . \\nTraditional non-spatial epidemiology models have been used use to represent epidemics of communicable diseases [3] . A Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) is an epidemiological model that describes the transmission process of an infectious disease [19] . The individuals enter or leave the compartment based on flow rates defined. There is a decrease in Susceptible individuals when individuals get infection, or they die. Number of individuals in the Exposed compartment increases when they get infection and decreases as soon as they show the symptoms of infection and decreases with the death rate. The infection compartment increases by the infection events of Exposed and decreases by the death and recovery rate. There is an increase in Recovered compartment with the recovery rate and decreases with the natural death. Another extension to the SIS model was proposed in [13] . It contains three population components: Humans (H), Vectors (M) and Eggs (E). 'L' represents the number of Latent mosquitoes that are in incubation period, as shown in Fig. 4 . At first a Susceptible human gets infection from a vector moves to the Infectious compartment. While at infectious state, a human may get recovered and move to the Recovered state or may die. An Infectious human may spread infection to a Susceptible vector which would move to the Latent compartment, where it stays for the time between getting Infection and becoming infectious, called latency period; the vector then moves to the Infectious compartment. A susceptible mosquito if lays eggs increases the population of susceptible vectors, whereas an Infectious mosquito if lays eggs would increase the population of Infectious vectors. It is also possible that an Infectious mosquito lays normal eggs. The main goal of modeling the life cycle of mosquitoes is to estimate the growth of the vector density at a place and time; and the interaction with the hosts to predict the rate of spread of disease. Our proposed approach is based on the foundation of this principle. \\nMost existing mathematical models focus on non-spatial macro-level aspects of the system. Because we are strongly interested in the micro-level aspects of our agents (a level where we can more easily extract rules and behaviors), we therefore use agent-based modelling. An agent-based model consists of autonomous decision-making entities: Agents, each able to perceptively assess situations and make decision according to a set of predefined rules. ABM is decentralized and produces collective behavior by agents communicating and interacting with each other in their environment [16] . The interest in using ABM has been recently renewed due to their ability to model complex geospatial structures and interacting networks [5] .\\nMany researchers have proposed different dengue epidemic simulation models. However, selection of the methodology and platform greatly depends upon the purpose of the study. Jacintho, et al. [16] propose an agent-based model of the dengue spread, using the Swarm platform that models the micro-level behavior of agents in the spread and transmission of dengue fever using a rule-based approach, however it lacks GIS based spatial representation. Almeida, et al. [1] propose an individual-based approach to model Aedes aegypti population considering vectors, humans and objects as agents, using repast framework. Kang and Aldstadt [17] proposed an approach to validate spatially explicit ABM for several specifications of vector-borne disease transmission models, using multiple scale spatio-temporal patterns. Hunter et al. [15] developed a data driven agent-based SEIR model that resulted in the emergence of patterns and behaviors that are not directly programmed into the model. Lima, et al. [20] developed DengueME, a collaborative open source platform to simulate dengue disease and its vector's dynamics. It supports compartmental and individual-based models, implemented over a GIS database, that represent Aedes aegypti population dynamics, human demography, human mobility, urban landscape and dengue transmission mediated by human and mosquito encounters. Yein Ling Hii [14] proposed a machine learning approach to study dengue fever considering climatic factors: temperature and rainfall using Poisson multivariate regression and validated through multiple statistical models. Guo, et al. [10] presented a comparison of various machine learning algorithms for the accurate prediction of dengue in China, and shows that support vector regression achieved a superior performance in comparison with other forecasting techniques assessed in this study.\\nOur proposed framework uses the mathematical model proposed by [13] , as underlying foundation and extend it using an ABM approach, which consists of two population layers: (i) human and (ii) vectors (mosquitoes and eggs). Both layers express the population dynamics, mobility and microscopic behavior of human and vector agents separately, yet provide a common spatial environment for their interactions, to study the spread of disease within the desired spatiotemporal resolution.\\nThis section discusses the details of our proposed framework which is composed of three layers: (i) Host Layer (Human population); (ii) Vector Layer (Mosquito population); and (iii) Pathogen Layer (Dengue parameters), as shown in Fig. 5 . The framework further integrates: (i) GIS based spatial environment for agent distribution and mobility; (ii) time step using a user defined temporal resolution (from Min to Year); (iii) simulation engine to handle change of states and dynamic event processing; (iv) database for importing input data and exporting simulation results; (v) exogenous variables for weather and climate data; and (vi) validation data for model validation. The framework also provide a visualization dashboard for viewing the change of states of the distributed population of agents in real-time (or virtual time a.k.a faster than real-time) and for the graph visualization of the simulation results. \\nThis layer concerns with the structure, behavior and the interactions of host agent and allows the modelers to initialize a host population (e.g., human or animals) using variable configurations. The behavior of the host agent is represented by a state chart, as shown in Fig. 6 which consists of six states: Susceptible, Exposed, Infected (or Immune), Recovered (or Dead). In this paper we assume the entire host population is initialized in Susceptible state. In the future, we intend to support a distribution of initial states so that we can use more realistic model configurations of a study area. When at 'Susceptible' state, a host agent receives an incoming message from an infectious mosquito, representing the 'infectious bite', it transits to an 'Exposed' state. After a certain period, defined by the incubation period parameter (3-8 days [28] ) either the host will transit to 'Infected' state or go to immune state (if resolved immune by the immunity probability). When at infected state, an incoming 'bite' message causes a self-loop transition, which is used to transmit the virus to an uninfected mosquito, with a given probability. After a certain duration, defined by the illness duration parameter (20 days) the host will transit to 'Recovered' state, if resolved true by the survival probability (0.9) or 'Dead' otherwise. We implement the interactions between Host and Vector agents using message passing and a distance based network type [2], which implies that a vector is connected with multiple hosts that are situated within a given range (36 m), and can communicate i.e. bite with infection or acquire an infection through a bite, as shown in Fig. 8 . The detailed bite algorithm is presented later in this section. \\nThis layer concerns with the structure, behavior and the interactions of vector agent. The behavior of the vector agent is represented by a state chart, as shown in Fig. 7 . It consists of states: Egg, Larva, Pupa and Adult (male or female). A vector agent can be initialized in any of these states. In this paper we assume initialize the vector population with the probability of 0.2 eggs, 0.2 larvae, 0.2 pupas and 0.4 adults (0.5 male and 0.5 female). The vector agents are uniformly distributed over the space, however this distribution can be fine tuned if the data of the concentrations of the mosquitoes nests is available. From egg, the agent moves on to the Larva state between 2-3 days. From larva it takes 4 days to transit to Pupa state, where it resides for 2 days and moves to the Adult stage, with a 0.5 probability to be a male or a female [6] . The male Aedes aegypti neither makes a bite nor transmits infection and dies after a lifespan of 14 days and then go to the final state 'dead '. A female mosquito can enter into the 'Oviposition' state when it is ready to lay eggs. A susceptible female will lay susceptible eggs whereas an infected female lay eggs with infectious probability = 0.3. The spawning of eggs is triggered by the event 'EggSpawn'. The initial state of an egg (infected or not) depends on whether the female mosquito is in Susceptible or infected state. The lifespan of the female mosquito is assumed to be between 42-56 days. Inspired from the Helmersson's mathematical model [13] , shown in Fig. 4 , the 'susceptible', 'latent' and 'Infected' states of the female mosquito are implemented. If not initially infected (i.e., IsInfected = false), an adult female mosquito enters into 'susceptible' state. It goes to 'latent' state if bites an infected human and acquires the virus (with a transmission probability of 0.18). The latent period is the delay from transmission to infection and is assumed to be 10 days, after which the agent enters into the 'Infected' state. While at 'susceptible' or 'Infected' states, a female mosquito bites human and have her fill of blood after each meal, at the rate of a bite after 2 days. Aedes aegypti is an intermittent biter and prefers to bite more than one person during the feeding period, therefore we assume it bites all the connected hosts. This bite is triggered by the event 'bite' at random intervals until the mosquito is dead When a 'bite' occurs the interaction between Host and Vector is implemented as shown in Algorithm 1. It takes VectorID and a list of ConnectedHosts as input. A vector is connected to all the hosts that lie within the range of 36 m. This algorithm determines infectivity of the vector after the bite using a boolean variable 'Infected'. Line1 assigns the existing state (infected or not) of the vector. Line 2-14 iterates a list of all the connected hosts and evaluate two scenarios as shown in Fig. 1 . If the vector is infected it will transmit an 'infectious bite' through message passing, and cause the host to transit from 'susceptible' to 'exposed' state. Else, if the host is infected the vector will acquire infection (with a 0.018 probability), and transit from 'susceptible' to 'Latent' state. Otherwise it will just 'bite' the host without the transmission of any infection. The number of times mosquito will bite human is defined by bite rate [13] , which is temperature dependent and is calculated as:\\nThis layer deals with the modalities of the pathogen under study i.e., 'Dengue' in our case. In this paper the structure and the behaviour of the pathogen is limited only to initialize the serotype (i.e., DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 or DENV4) and key parameters such as infectivity, transmisiability, survivability and incubation period. In future, we aim to extend this layer for dealing with the complex logic of the cross-immunity with different serotypes.\\nOur simulation is implemented using AnyLogic University Edition, and performed for a population of 50,000 persons and 1,000 mosquito agents, for a period of 90 days, on an Intel Core i7-8700 CPU@3.20 GHz, 16.0 GB RAM, and a 64-bit Windows Operating System. The human and mosquito populations are randomly distributed within a selected region in the city of Islamabad. A simulation run is shown using spatial and temporal visualization in Fig. 9 and 10. Initially the person agent population is susceptible, as soon as it is bitten by infectious mosquito it becomes Exposed (orange), after completing its incubation period of 4-7 days in exposed state it either becomes Infectious (red) or Immune (gray). From Infectious state after completing 4-12 days it either becomes Recovered (green) or Dead (black). The simulated results obtained are compared with the actual results of confirmed cases obtained from the dengue outbreak occurred in the local region in 2013. The actual cases were 9,036 out of the total population of 1,257,602 while the simulated cases were 400 out of the total agents' population of 50,000. In order to compare the data results of actual and simulated dengue cases, we calculated the prevalence of both data sets:\\nNo. of Dengue Cases Total Population × 100 (1) Fig. 11 . Comparison of dengue cases -Source of actual data [4] For comparison we present a graph containing both cases in Fig. 11 . We observe a similar trend in the prevalence of dengue cases between the actual and simulated results. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of both actual and simulated prevalence for the 90 days is 0.064. The results show that the dengue transmission is temperature dependent. It is to be noted that with the increase in temperature, the biting rate of Aedes aegypti increases that give rise to the dengue cases.\\nIn this paper we presented a framework for modeling, simulation, visualization and forecasting of dengue spread, using an agent-based modeling approach. Our framework incorporates the structure, behaviour and interactions of key entities of disease epidemiology: (i) Host (Humans); (ii) Vector (mosquitoes); and (iii) Pathogen (dengue virus), using a separation of concern through independent layers. Our open-ended framework offers greater flexibility to the modelers for modification and extensibility of the disease under study, and can be used as a research tool by stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, microbiologists and public health professionals) to study the epidemiology of a region. The unique feature of our framework is its ability to model the life-cycle and population dynamics of both host and vector population, while incorporating extended mathematical models for the study of the epidemic spread. In the absence of vector population data, this tool provides means to synthesize vector population, and help improve the understanding of the spread of diseases. In the future, we plan to improve our proposed framework further by adding the mobility layer to incorporate movements, both in the Host and Vector layers. We also aim to extend our framework to support populations of a million agents or more.\", 'Respiratory viruses are common causes of human disease. Molecular detection techniques have allowed previously known viruses to be more reliably identified and new viruses to be discovered [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Molecular techniques such as real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR) can be performed for each individual virus, or they can be combined into a multiplex RT-rtPCR assay. Other molecular methods that can target a single analyte or multiple viruses use a variety of nucleic acid detection based strategies, including microarrays [11] , mass spectrometry [12] , spectrally distinct bead microarrays [13] , capillary electrophoresis [14] , or microsphere flow cytometry [15] .\\nThe performance of molecular diagnostic methods, either RT-rtPCR or multiplex assays, typically has been evaluated by comparing them with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or culture, with few direct comparisons reported between molecular assays. Moreover, there are few reports of laboratories collaboratively comparing methods between institutions. In this study, we compared a multiplex respiratory virus panel (Respiratory MultiCode Assay [RMA], EraGen Biosciences and U. Wisconsin-Madison) with RT-rtPCR (Vanderbilt University) for the detection of 11 common respiratory viruses.\\nNasal and throat swabs were collected from children ≤ 12 months old who were admitted to the Monroe Carell Jr. Children\\'s Hospital at Vanderbilt from September 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 with acute respiratory illness, as part of the Tennessee Children\\'s Respiratory Initiative [16] . All specimens collected during this period were included in the study. Within four hours of collection, the samples were divided into aliquots, lysis buffer added, and specimens were frozen at -80°C. Separate unthawed aliquots were sent to the research laboratories at Vanderbilt University and University of Wisconsin-Madison for RT-rtPCR and RMA testing, respectively.\\nSingle RT-rtPCR experiments were performed for the following 11 viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3), and human coronaviruses Netherlands (NL-63), OC43, and 229E. RNA was extracted on an automated instrument (MagNApure Total Nucleic Acid extraction kit; Roche Applied Science), and refrozen at -80°C until each individual RT-rtPCR was performed. Primers and probes for HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, RSV, HMPV and HRV were obtained from the published literature [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Influenza primer and probe sequences were provided by Steve Lindstrom, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [23] . Primers and probes for PIV1, 2 and 3 were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Primer and probe sequences, concentration, and annealing temperatures are listed in Table 1 . Twenty-five-μL reaction mixtures containing 5 μL of specimen RNA were tested using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) on a Smart Cycler II (Cepheid). Cycling conditions were 30 min at 50°C, 15 min at 94°C, and 45 cycles of 8 seconds at 94°C and 60 seconds at 55-66°C (Table 1 ). All RT-rtPCR assays were optimized and characterized using RNA runoff transcripts and were capable of detecting < 50 RNA transcript copies/reaction (data not shown). All samples were tested by a commercial RT-rtPCR assay for human beta-actin mRNA (Applied Biosystems) to ensure RNA integrity.\\nRMA is a multitarget, high throughput technology that integrates multiplex PCR and microsphere flow cytometry [15, 24, 25] . While the Luminex technology can detect up to 80 targets in one reaction, this version of the assay included 19 viral targets. We report results for the same 11 viruses tested by the RT-rtPCR assays. Nucleic acid was extracted with Trizol reagents. The RMA assay was performed with primers and conditions as previously described, including the addition of an external insect virus spiked into each specimen to control for RNA extraction, RT, and PCR [15] .\\nBoth sites were blinded to the results from the other laboratory until all data were analyzed. In order to address potential weaknesses indicated by discordant results between the two assays in the first round of comparison, both RT-rtPCR and RMA testing were modified for a second round of testing. The first round primers and probes for RSV and HMPV [19, 21] were changed for the RT-rtPCR assay [18] and (Klemenc et al, unpublished data) and all samples were retested for these two viruses. In the RMA assay, the primers and probe for influenza A were modified and the cDNA synthesis protocol was changed from Promega reagents to the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Kit.\\nDemographic and clinical variables of the study sample are described as frequencies and percent or median and interquartile ranges [IQR] as appropriate. The RMA and RT-rtPCR assays were compared using the test for inter-rater agreement (kappa coefficient). Kappa coefficient was calculated for any comparison in which the value of all data cells was ≥ 3, with a kappa ≥ 0.75 considered to indicate good agreement. Bootstrapping was used to estimate 95% confidence limits of kappa. Cycle threshold (Ct) numbers for influenza and RSV were compared between groups of specimens using the t-test.\\nA total of 225 infants hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were enrolled from September 2005 through May 2006. Samples from 222 children were available for study in both sites; three specimens were only available for RMA testing. Study children were 57% male with a median age of 13 weeks [IQR 7-33 weeks]. The admitting diagnoses of these infants were bronchiolitis (58%), upper respiratory infection (33%), and other (9%).\\nRates of viral detection were compared using both assay methods. Restricting the analysis to the 11 viruses tested with both methods, at least one virus was detected in 174 (78.3%) samples by RMA and in 163 (73.4%) samples by RT-rtPCR. A total of 194 and 196 viruses were identified in these samples by RMA and RT-rtPCR, respectively (Table 2) .\\nIn the first round of testing, RMA detected more RSV (n = 98, 44%) than RT-rtPCR (n = 78, 35%). The kappa coefficient between the two tests was 0.66. RMA also differentiated between RSV sub-types A and B. Of the RSV positive samples detected by RMA, 67 were RSV A and 32 were RSV B (one sample had both RSV A and RSV B). Of the 67 RSV A identified through RMA, RT-rtPCR detected RSV in 65 (97%) of them. However, of the 42 RSV B detected by RMA, RT-rtPCR only detected RSV B in 6 (14.2%) samples.\\nIn the second round, the primers and probes for the RSV RT-rtPCR assay were redesigned based on further analysis of published viral sequences [18] . Using these new primers and probes, RSV was identified in 107 (49%) samples with RT-rtPCR. The inter rater agreement for RSV between the repeat RT-rtPCR and the first RMA was 0.86. Of the 67 RSV A and 32 RSV B detected by the RMA assay, the repeat sample analysis detected RSV in 66 and 28 respectively. 12 samples were positive for RSV with repeat RT-rtPCR testing but negative for RSV with RMA testing; the mean Ct for these specimens was higher than the mean Ct for specimens detected by both assays (34.54 ± 3.18 vs. 28.58 ± 3.71, p < 0.001).\\nIn the first round, the RT-rtPCR detected influenza A in 25 (11.2%) samples while the RMA detected influenza A in 7 (3.1%) samples. RT-rtPCR detected influenza B in 1 sample while RMA detected influenza B in a different sample. In the second round of testing, the influenza A RMA primers and probes were redesigned. Compared to 25 samples positive for influenza A by rRT-PCR, the repeat RMA assay detected 5 positive samples; all 5 were also detected by the RT-rtPCR assay. The mean Ct of the 5 influenza A specimens detected by the RMA assay was lower than the mean Ct of all influenza A specimens (30.02 ± 1.98 vs. 34.99 ± 1.88, p < 0.001).\\nRT-rtPCR detected HRV in 63 (28.2%) samples as compared to the RMA, which detected HRV in 56 (25.1%) samples (kappa coefficient 0.78). In two of the discordant samples, RT-rtPCR detected HRV while the RMA detected enterovirus.\\nDuring the first round of testing, RMA detected HMPV in 8 (3.5%) samples while RT-rtPCR detected HMPV in 2 (0.9%) samples. In the second round using redesigned RT-rtPCR HMPV primers and probes, HMPV was detected in 7 samples, 5 of which were concordant with the results of the first RMA assay. The first RMA assay detected HMPV in 2 additional samples that were not detected by the repeat RT-rtPCR assay, while one sample positive for HMPV in the first RMA was negative in the second set of tests.\\nNL63 was detected in 8 (3.5%) samples through RMA and in 6 (2.7%) samples through RT-rtPCR. HCoV OC43 was detected in 5 (2.2%) samples through RMA and in 5 (2.3%) samples through RT-rtPCR. HCoV 229E was not detected in any sample by either assay.\\nPIV1 was detected in 10 (4.4%) samples through RMA and in 13 (5.8%) samples through RT-rtPCR. PIV 2 was detected in 1 (0.5%) sample through RMA and in 1 (0.5%) sample through RT-rtPCR. No PIV3 was detected by either method. \\nThe comparison of the first and second run of RMA assay is summarized in Table 2 . The most notable discrepancies between runs were for HRV and RSV.\\nThe sensitivity and specificity of multiplex viral diagnostic assays have generally been compared to viral culture and DFA [1] , instead of more sensitive RT-rtPCR methods [2, [26] [27] [28] . Comparison of molecular methods with other sensitive molecular techniques, such as RMA with RT-rtPCR, is appropriate to determine whether the sensitivity for each analyte is sufficient for clinical or research use. Although both assays performed well for selected viruses in this study, the first round of comparison revealed differences in the rates of detection for specific viruses ( Table  2 ). The RMA assay detected significantly more HMPV and RSV, while the RT-rtPCR assay detected more influenza A and HRV. Redesigning primers led to substantial improvements in the detection of HMPV and RSV by rRT-PCR, while there was little improvement in the performance of RMA for influenza virus with the change in primers. This discordance could have been due to sequence variation; there was insufficient residual specimen to sequence the viruses. However, both influenza A assays targeted regions of the matrix gene that are highly conserved among GenBank sequences (data not shown). The mean Ct of the influenza and RSV specimens detected only by the RT-rtPCR assay was significantly higher than those detected by the RMA assay, suggesting that the discordance may have been due to the sensitivity of the two assays for specimens with a lower viral load. One recent study compared a commercial version of the RMA known as PLx-Respiratory Viral Assay (PLx-RVP) to RT-rtPCR and found good concordance, but only tested a portion of the PLx-RVP negative samples [29] . The RMA and PLx-RVP differ both in primer sequences, and in the method used to extract RNA and perform reverse transcription. Both of these factors are important determinants of assay sensitivity. Given that RNA viruses are prone to mutation [30] , currently circulating field strains of these viruses should be regularly monitored for sequence divergences that would affect primers and probes used in PCR-based assays. This is particularly true for influenza, which undergoes considerable variation every year. Molecular assays are often targeted to conserved internal genes, but this is based on known sequences. Further, due to segment reassortment and antigenic shift, new internal gene segments may arise among influenza viruses infecting humans. For multiplex assays such as the RMA, inclusion of two probe sets that target two different parts of the viral genome might eliminate the risk that a single mutation would lead to nondetection.\\nOur study has some limitations. First, we did not use identical extraction methods and primers in the RT-rtPCR and RMA assays, and therefore discrepant results could have been due to differences in these processes or primer design. However, this was an intentional choice, since the specific goal of this study was to compare two \"real-world\" methods. Both laboratories have published extensively in the area of respiratory virus diagnostics and epidemiology, and have evaluated their independent methods. This study shows that collaboration between groups offers a valuable tool to assess assay performance impartially. Second, we did not use a gold standard test to confirm presence or absence of virus in cases of discrepancy between the two assays. We explored the option of sequencing of the discordant samples to detect sequence differences or false positives, but there was not enough residual specimen to allow this. Nonetheless, we repeated the testing of viruses that had major discrepancies with the assumption that if the repeats were positive, it provided reassurance that the positive samples were true positives. Third, the RT-rtPCR was only repeated for HMPV and RSV due to limited sample; there could have been discordances for other viruses. Fourth, the RMA assay was repeated with altered influenza primers while other primers were unchanged; it is possible that a change in influenza primers had an impact on the overall performance of the assay. One important consideration for any multiplex assay is the need to re-optimize for all targets when a change is made in any of the primers used. Finally, the results were not evaluated by DFA or culture, though the objective was to directly compare sequence-based methods.\\nIn summary, for most viruses tested, there was good agreement between the two assays. However, discrepancies highlight the need for similar comparisons between molecular assays on a routine basis, so that weaknesses can be promptly identified and corrected. While investigators may be reluctant to make comparisons that might suggest deficiencies of particular methods, collaborative studies such as ours are critical to advance these diagnostic methodologies. Two other recent studies comparing molecular methods identified similar discrepancies [29, 31] . In addition to clinical specimens validated by culture, respiratory virus proficiency panels distributed by quality control programs like the European Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) [32] , CDC, or College of American Pathologists, or commercial proficiency panels (e.g., ZeptoMetrix NATtrol™ Respiratory Validation Panels) provide an external quality control. Clearly, the overall comparison between molecular methods should consider the performance of each individual analyte. The goal of this study was not to determine which is the \"best\" assay; the choice of assay for a given purpose depends on many factors, including cost, available equipment and expertise, sample volume, and others. Multiplex assays may offer substantial savings in time and cost due to multiple analytes, and are generally preferred for clinical testing. Comparison of molecular diagnostic methods to culture and DFA is useful to establish validity, and ensure that cultivable viruses are correctly identified by sequence-based technology. However, our data show that molecular diagnostic methods also must be compared to other molecular techniques to assess performance, particularly because of the superior sensitivity of the molecular methods compared to culture and DFA.', \"There is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a kind of positive singlestranded RNA virus with an envelope structure (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) . It was the seventh known coronavirus able to infect humans . The human infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can induce severe pulmonary disease and complications with significant morbidities and mortalities Yang X. et al., 2020; Zhang J.-j. et al., 2020) . According to the released statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 worldwide have so far exceeded 180 million and four million with a continuous upward tendency (https://covid19.who.int/table). Despite the disastrous effect of COVID-19 on public health, civil society, and the global economy, there is currently still no specific drug available against it. Hence, the search for effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infections is in urgent demand.\\nThe invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells relies on the spike protein on the surface of its envelope (Walls et al., 2020) . In humans, the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) Zhang H. et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recognizes and binds to ACE2 through the receptor-binding domain . Then it is hydrolytically activated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and mediates subsequent virushost cell membrane fusion ( Figure 1A ) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . The binding affinity between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 has been determined to be low to ∼15 nM and 10 to 20 fold higher than that reported in SARS-CoV in 2002, which may be an important cause of the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Considering such a critical role of the interaction between spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, the inhibition of such interaction is considered as a particularly attractive strategy for the development of treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections (Li et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020; Yang J. et al., 2020) .\\nRecently, virtual screening and high throughput screening studies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction have discovered several small molecule inhibitors ( Figure 1B ) (Carino et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Hanson et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021) . Nevertheless, the antiviral activities of some compounds, such as corilagin, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and glycyrrhizic acid, are not clear (Carino et al., 2020; Hanson et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020) . Visudyne shows intense antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. However, its cytotoxicity data is not reported (Fu et al., 2020) . Besides, demethylzeylasteral and cediranib have undergone pseudovirus and cytotoxicity tests, but only demethylzeylasteral shows slight FIGURE 1 | The routes of SARS-CoV-2 invade into host cells (A) and several representative inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction (B).\\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 740702 inhibitory activity (approximately 7%) against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus under nontoxic concentration . Hence, there remains a critical need and challenge to discover safe and effective inhibitors against the interaction between S-RBD and ACE2. In this study, we identified two novel inhibitors (named DC-RA016 and DC-RA052) against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction through structure-based virtual screening and biological experiments. NanoLuc binary technology (NanoBiT)-based binding and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay demonstrated that DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 could bind to both S-RBD and ACE2, blocking the interaction between them. Additionally, the pseudovirus assay and cytotoxicity experiment showed that both DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 have moderate inhibition ability to SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus and low cytotoxicity. In addition, the preliminary pharmacophore analysis and the mechanism action study of DC-RA016 were carried out to further uncover the inhibitory mechanism of the compound on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. Therefore, these two compounds are promising new inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and worth further development.\\nThe whole virtual screening process was carried out using Schrödinger Suite 2017 on a Linux server with four 6-core Intel Xeon E5-4607 CPUs and 32 GB of memory. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD bound to ACE2 (PDB code: 6M0J) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the docking studies. This crystal structure was prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard module with default parameters. The process of protein preparation included the determination of valence bonds, the addition of hydrogen atom, removal of water molecule and heteroatom, optimization of hydrogen bond network, optimization of the orientation of Asn, Gln, and His, and restrained structural optimization. Finally, a grid box containing the contact interface of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 complexes was generated with the Receptor Grid Generation module by manually setting the central coordinate. The size of the grid box was defined as 30 × 30 × 30 Å.\\nSmall molecules in the SPECS commercial compound database were selected for virtual screening. In order to avoid false positives caused by pan assay interference compounds (PAINS), the compounds containing PAINS structural alert were removed with the Structure Filter module in Canvas. Subsequently, the three-dimensional coordinates, different stereoisomers, and protonation states at pH 7.0 ± 2.0 of remaining compounds were generated with LigPred Module. The resulting structures were used for docking.\\nThe final molecular docking was performed with the Virtual Screening Workflow module. All treated molecules were first docked into the defined interface pocket in standard precision mode. Then the top poses were further docked in extra precision mode.\\nThe structural similarity between the two molecules was calculated using the 1024-dimensional Morgan fingerprints with radius two and the Tanimoto coefficient. The calculation of fingerprints and the Tanimoto coefficient were both implemented with the RDkit python package.\\nThe tested compounds were purchased from SPECS (Zoetermeer, Netherlands) and used directly without further purification. All compounds were first dissolved in DMSO and subsequently diluted to the final bioassay concentration.\\nThe initial screening and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) determination of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction inhibitors were conducted as previously described (Yu et al., 2020) . Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD-LgBiT (S residues 319-591) and SmBiT-ACE2 (ACE2 residues 19-615) fusion plasmids were transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells in a 6-well plate using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). After 6 h, the HEK293 cells were reseeded into a 384well plate for screening the active compounds. The compounds were added at indicated concentrations and plates were incubated for 3 h. After the addition of Nano-Glo live Cell Assay reagent, luminescence was determined using the Envision plate reader (EnVision, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, United States). To exclude the false positives, the cytotoxicity of the compounds on the HEK293 cells and the inhibitory effects of the compounds on NanoLuc (HEK293/Nanoluc stable cells) were also measured, respectively. The activities of the compounds were evaluated using the inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction (NanoBiT inh%), NanoLuc luciferase (NanoLuc inh%) and the cell proliferation (Cytotox inh%, CC 50 ) on HEK293 cells.\\nThree separate plasmids including pAX2, pHB-Rluc and pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2-S were obtained from Precedo (Anhui, China). HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, United States) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ExCell Bio, Shanghai, China) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 at 37°C. HEK293T cells grown to 70% confluency were co-transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids using LipoFiter 3.0 transfection reagent (Hanbio, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 6 h of transfection, HEK293T cells were refreshed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses in the supernatant was harvested at 48 h, filtered using a 0.45 μm membrane (Jet Bio-Filtration, Guangzhou, China) and stored in aliquots at −80°C until use. Subsequently, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-ACE2 (Precedo, Anhui, China) or with vector alone. Transfected HEK293T cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of test compounds at 37°C for 1 h. Then, SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus and Polybrene (6 μg/ml) (Absin, Shanghai, China) were added to infect the cells for 24 h. After that, the cells were further cultured with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS for an additional 24 h. Then cells were lysed with Cell Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, United States), and the luciferase activity was detected using a Multilabel Reader (SpectraMax Paradigm, Molecular Devices, CA, United States). The inhibition rate (%) was calculated by the equation: (the luminescence of the test compounds/the maximum luminescence after transfection for SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus) × 100%. IC 50 values were determined via nonlinear regression analysis using GrapPad Prism software 8.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States). The cytotoxicity of the test compounds was determined using the CellTiter-Glo (CTG) Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Selectivity index (SI) for each compound was calculated by dividing CC 50 (cytotoxicity on HEK293T cells) by IC 50 (the inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus). The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration (MNCC) was defined as the concentration required to retain cell viability by 90% and calculated according to the previously published method (Cheng et al., 2013) . The inhibition of the compounds to SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infectivity at MNCC was fitted based on the inhibition curve and expressed as the inhibition ratio (%I).\\nA BIAcore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United States) was used to evaluate the binding affinity of the test compounds to human ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as previously described (Li et al., 2017) . Briefly, both proteins were respectively immobilized on the different channels of CM5 sensor chip by a standard amine-coupling approach at a flow rate of 10 μL/min in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0). The sensor surface was activated with a 7 min injection of the mixture of 50 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 200 mM 1ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). Then 10 μg/ml of human ACE2 or 50 μg/ml of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was injected for 420 s and the surface was blocked with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Series concentrations of the test compounds were injected into the flow system at a flow rate of 30 μL/min for 90 s, and the dissociation was 120 s. All binding analysis was performed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and 1% DMSO (pH 7.4) at 25°C. Prior to analysis, double reference subtractions and solvent corrections were made to eliminate bulk refractive index changes, injection noise, and data drift. The binding affinity was determined by fitting to a Langmuir 1:1 binding model within the BIAcore Evaluation software (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United States).\\nStatistical analyses were performed using GrapPad Prism software 8.0. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance between different groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001).\\nIn structure-based virtual screening, the primary thing is to choose the appropriate docking pocket and protein crystal structure. However, according to our observation, the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and human ACE2 don't have druggable pockets near the contact interface in their unbound forms. Only when they are bound together, there is a well-defined pocket presented on their contact interface, which is hence defined as the docking pocket in the current study. A crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ human ACE2 complex was obtained from PDB and pretreated for virtual screening. The compounds for virtual screening were obtained from the SPECS database and first filtered by PAINS rules. The 202,829 remaining compounds were docking to the previously selected pocket after ligand preparation. The molecular docking was first carried out in standard precision mode. The top 10% poses ranked by SP score were redocked in extra precision mode. The top 20% candidates ranked by XP score were subsequently subjected to cluster analysis and visual inspection to pick the compounds with diversity and reasonable binding mode. Finally, 109 candidate compounds were selected and then purchased for follow-up biological testing. The whole process of the discovery of inhibitors against the interaction between S-RBD and ACE2 protein is schematically depicted in Figure 2 .\\nTo discover SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction inhibitors, a NanoBiT-based assay was applied for preliminary screening. 24 of 109 compounds showed the primary inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction under 20 and 50 μM concentration, no inhibitory effects on NanoLuc luciferase and cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure S1) . We next assessed these compounds for their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus. Among of them, five compounds were identified as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus ( Figure 4A ). We further determined IC 50 values of these compounds with serially- (E) DC-RA106. NanoBiT inh%: the inhibition rates against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction; NanoLuc inh%: the inhibition rates against NanoLuc luciferase; Cytotox inh%: the inhibition rates against the transfected HEK293 cell proliferation. n 3.\\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 740702 5 diluted concentrations for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction (NanoBiT inh%), NanoLuc luciferase (NanoLuc inh%) and CC 50 values for the cytotoxicity (Cytotox inh%) on HEK293 cells (Figure 3) . It was shown that DC-RA016, DC-RA052, DC-RA076, DC-RA087 and DC-RA106 exhibited dosedependent inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction, and their IC 50 values were 26.63, 62.08, 75.60, 86.17 and 24.73 μM, respectively. These compounds had no obvious inhibitory activities against NanoLuc luciferase (IC 50 > 100 μM). It was observed that these compounds were low cytotoxicity with CC 50 greater than 100 μM. Thus, the five compounds could disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2.\\nTo evaluate whether the compounds can inhibit the attachment of SARS-CoV-2, a pseudovirus based inhibition assay was established. Due to 24 compounds showing the potent blocking activities against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction in the initial NanoBiT assay, we next detected the inhibitory activities of these compounds in SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus based inhibition assay with the final concentrations of 10 and 100 μM. As shown in Figure 4A , five compounds significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus attachment to ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells at a concentration of 100 μM (p < 0.001 \\nTo further validate the inhibitory mechanism of the five compounds against SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus attachment, SPR assay was carried out to investigate whether these compounds could directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2. As shown in Figure 5 , . All these binding displayed fast kinetics, except for DC-RA087 to human ACE2 ( Figure 5G ). For DC-RA076, no binding was observed for both targets. DC-RA052 exhibited high affinities to both SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 and the KD values were 21.66 and 34.71 μM, respectively. In spite of concentrationdependent binding curves, saturated binding seemed not reached for DC-RA106, which could lead to poor quality of affinity regression (KD > 100.00 μM). In view of the previous results of the SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus-based inhibition assay, compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 were ultimately identified as the two most promising hits blocking the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment.\\nThrough the 2D similarity search, we found there were a few molecules similar to DC-RA016 in the SPECS database. Hence, 12 analogues of DC-RA016 were purchased to explore the structureactivity relationship of it. Their inhibition ability to the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and human ACE2 were tested by NanoBiT assay. As shown in Table 2 , those compounds whose R1 groups were not 3,5-dihydroxy phenyl group all displayed no inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 interaction. Among the four compounds having the same R1 group with DC-RA016, two compounds (DC-RA016-9 and DC-RA016-12) could disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 under the concentration of 50 and 20 μM. We further determined their dose-dependent inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction, NanoLuc luciferase and cytotoxicity on HEK293 cells. It was found that DC-RA016-12 exhibited the similar activity (IC 50 26.06 μM) (Supplementary Figure S2A) to DC-RA016 (IC 50 26.63 μM), while DC-RA016-9 displayed less inhibitory activity (IC 50 73.84 μM) (Supplementary Figure S2B ) than DC-RA016. IC 50 : the 50% inhibitory concentration of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus; CC 50 : cytotoxicities on ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells; MNCC: maximum non-cytotoxic concentration; %I: SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus inhibition ratio at MNCC; SI: selectivity index.\\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 740702 FIGURE 5 | The binding affinity between the five compounds and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2. Compounds bound to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2. Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2 with compounds measured by SPR. The SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2 was coated on the CM5 sensor chip and serial dilutions of compounds (typically, 1,562.5, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, 50, To analyze the mechanism of action of DC-RA016, the binding pose of the compound DC-RA016 on the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface was generated by XP docking. As shown in Figure 6A , DC-RA016 could form strong interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 complex interface. The two phenolic hydroxyls of DC-RA016 respectively formed H-bonds with the His-34 of ACE2 and Gly496 of S-RBD. The replacement of the R1 group of DC-RA016 with other structures would disrupt such interaction, which provided the structural explanation for the impaired activity of compounds DC-RA016-1 to DC-RA016-8. Additionally, an electrostatic interaction also occurred between the nitro of DC-RA016 and Asp-30 of ACE2, which accounted for the stronger inhibitory activity of compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA016-12 than compounds DC-RA016-9, DC-RA016-10, and DC-RA016-11. Compared with DC-RA016, the change of the position of chlorine substitution in DC-RA016-12 didn't have obvious effects on its inhibitory activity. Moreover, although its R 2 group was quite different from that of DC-RA016, DC-RA016-9 still displayed certain inhibitory activity. These results suggested that the R 2 group was not the essential pharmacophore of DC-RA016, so we plan to carry further structural modification on this group in the future.\\nThe docking analysis on DC-RA052, another important inhibitor, was also carried out. As shown in Figure 6B , Lys-417, Gln-409, Glu-406, Arg-403, Tyr-505 of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, and His-34 of ACE2 were found to form H-bonds with DC-RA052. Moreover, the benzene ring and pyridine ring of DC-RA052 formed π-cation interaction with the Arg-408 and Arg-403 of S-RBD. Comparing the binding modes of DC-RA016 and DC-RA052, it could be noted that both DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 interacted with the Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2. Then, based on the docked complex structures, we calculated the per-residue interaction scores with glide. The results indicated the strong interaction of Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 to DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 (Supplementary Table S1 ). Moreover, as shown in Figure 6C , there was a deep pocket (marked with the red circle) on the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface. Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 were both at the edge of this pocket. Hence, we considered Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 as two key residues responsible for the binding of ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ ACE2 interface. To explore the reason why the binding of identified inhibitors can influence SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction, the mean effects of mutation of each residue within 5 Å of DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 were visualized. The data for visualization was obtained from a previous study, where Starr et al. systematically changed every amino acid in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and determined the effects of the substitutions on ACE2 binding. The mean effects per site were calculated from the set of Δlog 10 (K D , app) measurements of all missense mutations at a site (Starr et al., 2020) . Δlog 10 (K D , app) represents the log binding constants relative to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , the mutations of many residues around DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 such as Ile-418 and Phe-497 could significantly reduce the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2, which mean these residues played key roles in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. And yet, binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface, DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 would contact with these residues and interfere with their functions, disrupting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2.\\nPrior work has demonstrated that the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and the ACE2 receptor plays a critical role in the virus invasion into the host cell. Hence interference of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction is regarded as a promising antiviral Frontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 740702\", \"Uncontrolled bleeding is the most common cause of preventable death in trauma victims [1] . Multiple circumstances play a role in the timely arrest of hemorrhage (and ultimately in survival), including transport times [2] , expeditious evaluation by an experienced trauma team, and the availability of resources to obtain hemostasis, surgically or otherwise [3] . The state of Illinois has a robust trauma system (established in 1971 as the first in the United States), and it conducted a feasibility study (published in 2015) [4] which ultimately resulted in the foundation of the Trauma Center at Memorial Hospital of Carbondale, a Barnes-Jewish Collaborative member located in the last designated trauma desert in the state [4] . New protocols have been initiated for the management of traumatic injuries including a two-tiered trauma response (see Table 1 ). These factors integrate to form a safety network that makes otherwise lethal injuries survivable. Their relevance only increases when difficult medical comorbidities complicate a rare presentation or an unusual injury that requires both a high index of suspicion and targeted therapy, while avoiding potential pitfalls. The two cases below exemplify these dynamics in our newly designated trauma center serving an otherwise austere environment.\\nA 67-year-old (yo) lumberjack arrived with a category I activation after being airlifted from the scene of a work accident. The prehospital report described the patient as found lying next to the trunk he just felled. His systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) was 60/30 during the flight, but his pulse was in the 30-40 range. Ringer's lactate (Baxter International, Deerfield, IL) was infused through an 18gauge (Ga) intravenously (IV) in the arm, and his transport time was 21 minutes. Upon arrival, he was placed on the monitors and his clothes were removed. He was intermittently conscious and confused regarding the details of the incident. His initial vitals were 75/42 and 54 with a right bundle branch block pattern and diffuse T-wave inversion.

His respiratory sounds were equal bilaterally, and his heart tones appeared normal. He complained of chest pain and lower back pain. A Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma with added limited echocardiography (E-FAST) exam was negative for fluid, and both his abdominal palpation and pelvic stability were deemed normal. The massive transfusion protocol (MTP) was initiated as we got report from a family member: he had a history of coronary artery disease (2 stents 4 months before presentation) and atrial fibrillation (ablated 2 years prior) and was receiving apixaban (Eliquis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) and clopidogrel (Plavix, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY). Upon logrolling the patient, a firm, slightly bruised mass was found in his right paralumbar area, extending to his right lateral iliac crest, tender on palpation. After 2 units (U) of O-negative, 5 U of cross-matched packed red blood cells (PRBC), 5 U of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of platelets, 1000 mg of tranexamic acid (TXA) (Cyklokapron, Pfizer, New York, NY), and 4500 mg of 4F-PCC (Kcentra, CSL Behring, King of Prussia, PA), his vitals were 85/48 and 62. Pelvic X-rays failed to show any bony fractures or diastasis symphysis pubis. The patient was then transported to the CT scanner while still connected to the Belmont infuser (Belmont Medical, Billerica, MA) and receiving the rest of the first round of the MTP. The CT showed a very large hematoma within the confines of the abdominal wall, with a clear arterial phase extravasation (blush) (Figure 1, arrow) . The only other injury noted in the study was a nondisplaced fracture of the right transverse process of L1. The head CT was read as within normal limits. He was then transported to the Interventional Radiology (IR) suite, where his left femoral artery was cannulated.\\nSelective angiography examinations of his aorta and common iliacs, right hypogastric trunk, right iliolumbar branch, and L4 right lumbar branches were performed, revealing a pseudoaneurysm of the distal ramus lumbalis of the right iliolumbar artery cranial and medial to the right iliac crest (Figure 2) , which was embolized using Gelfoam (Pfizer, New York, NY) slurry and Ruby coils (Penumbra, Alameda, CA), obtaining angiostasis (Figure 3, arrow) . Additional embolotherapy was administered to the L4 right lumbar artery anastomosis to the deep right iliac circumflex artery. Postprocedure, the patient was transferred to the ICU, where his vitals were 185/99 and HR 78. Serial troponins rose modestly to 0.56, and cardiology recommended resuming clopidogrel upon discharge. The skin of his right lower back bruised up over the next 48 hours, but the mass remained stable. An additional follow-up was arranged for cardiology for the resumption of his apixaban as an outpatient. \\nAny patient that is transferred from another facility for further definitive care meeting the above criteria Any patient that is transferred from another facility for further definitive care meeting the above criteria Additional criteria At the discretion of the ED physician for patients that do not strictly meet the above criteria At the discretion of the ED physician for patients that do not strictly meet the above criteria \\nCase. An 80 yo lady was brought in with a category II activation (transfer) after sustaining a fall from standing height at home. The patient stated that she lost her footing and hit a wooded armoire in the right side of her lower back. She was initially transported to a critical access hospital, where the only finding in her physical exam was a very large hematoma on the right side of her back, and she was mildly hypotensive (88/50). Her initial BP on arrival to the trauma center (after 2 L of Ringer's lactate) was 101/52. Her primary survey confirmed the findings at the other hospital. Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes. Her medications included a beta blocker, an oral hypoglycemic agent, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (Ecotrin, Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc., Greenburgh, NY), and warfarin (Coumadin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY). STAT hemoglobin was measured as 7.2 g/dL (a drop from 14 two months prior). Her International Normalized Ratio (INR) was measured at 4.02. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained (Figure 4) , showing an 18:3 cm × 4:9 cm × 16:8 cm right flank hematoma with active extravasation. Additional injuries included nondisplaced fractures of the right transverse processes of L1 and L2. Upon return to the trauma bay, her blood pressure dropped again to the high 80's. The Belmont infuser was connected, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma with 2 units of packed red blood cells were rapidly infused. In addition, 10 mg of IV vitamin K was given, while the IR team prepared the angiography suite.\\nThe patient was then transported to the IR suite, where her right femoral artery was cannulated.\\nSelective angiography examinations of her aorta and common iliacs, right hypogastric trunk, right iliolumbar branch, and L4 right lumbar branches were performed, revealing active hemorrhage from an anastomotic vessel between the right L4 and the ramus lumbalis of the right iliolumbar artery ( Figure 5 ). Gelfoam slurry followed by 2 Nester 2 × 4 mm microcoils (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) was embolized to stasis, confirmed by digital subtraction (Figure 6 ). The rest of the angiography was within normal limits. Postprocedure, she was transported to the ICU, where her vitals remained stable.\\n3.1. First Case. He was discharged on hospital day 3. No complications were found at 60-day follow-up, and he resumed his commercial logging activities. With the onset of the COVID-19 emergency restrictions, he was furloughed. We contacted him at home by phone, and he has developed arthritic right knee pain. The hematoma has begun liquefying, and he will be returning to have it drained if it does not disappear by the time he is due back at the logging field.\\nShe was deemed to be too frail to return home immediately and was discharged to acute inpatient rehab 72 hours after the procedure, and she remained there for a week until she was discharged home. On her first follow-up (4 weeks after the injury), she remained in her usual state of health. Her hematoma had liquefied as well and was experiencing regression in size. She was readmitted 7 weeks after the injury with neurological symptoms suggestive of an ischemic stroke. Her lesion was diminished in size compared to her previous follow-up. She was considered to have contraindications for the use of TPA, and given her general medical condition, no neurointerventions were recommended. She was discharged to neurorehabilitation with continued aphasia.\\nTraumatic shock carries severe morbidity and mortality that correlate with the time required to stop all bleeding [1, 2] . Case Reports in Surgery\\nUnderstanding the mechanism of injury is critical to anticipate the most likely sources of hemorrhage and provide measures geared towards hemostasis. Extremity bleeding is easily identified, and control might be initiated at the scene with the use of splints to reduce fractures and tourniquets. Visible blood loss responds to direct compression and surgical interventions aimed at terminating exsanguination and restoring distal perfusion. Torso hemorrhages most commonly occur within the pleural or the peritoneal cavities, which are not compressible and require operative management. They require a high index of suspicion and a certain level of expertise to diagnose promptly and manage appropriately [3, 5] . Virtual spaces such as the retroperitoneum and the pelvic space are closely linked to specific lesions and mechanisms of injury (i.e., pelvic fractures, deceleration trauma, and seatbelts) [5] .\\nNoncavitary torso bleeding is a very rare cause for hemorrhagic shock [6] [7] [8] [9] . While the mortality potential for this noncompressible hematoma has been documented before [10, 11] , the associated risk factors are poorly understood: a brief revision of the reported few cases in the available biomedical literature suggests some common features: advanced age [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and localized high-energy blunt force in the lower back [6] [7] [8] [9] , with (or most frequently without) associated fractures in the lumbar spine and shearing of an arterial bleeder that dissects an otherwise closed space (either at the skin or in the fascial layers of the back or the buttocks) [6] [7] [8] [9] . The most commonly associated blood vessel is the iliolumbar artery [9, 12] , a surgically difficult-to-access vessel with significant anatomical variations [12] [13] [14] , considered an inconsistent part of the corona mortis [15] .\\nThere have been a number of recent cases reported in the context of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and other indications that add a layer of complexity to the injury [16] . It is well known that patients that sustain trauma (of any kind) while receiving anticoagulation are older, have more comorbidities and higher injury severity scores, and have the worst outcomes compared to the general trauma population [3, 16] . Within the United States, they also cluster in more exurban areas, which are poorly served by specialist care [2] . It is known that properly planned trauma networks are effective at closing the gap of care between urban and rural trauma by bringing needed expertise closer to the injury site [1] . The two cases reported above show those dynamics at work: an elderly exsanguinating patient, with severe comorbidities and affected by a rare injury requiring significant expertise not usually available at austere settings and unlikely to survive through transfer to a remote regional trauma center, having a good outcome secondary to a high index of suspicion and immediately available resources. One issue that remains controversial is the most appropriate timing to resume anticoagulation (both antiplatelet agents and factor X inhibitors) as the management strategies and different final outcomes above illustrate. A review of the literature [17] shows different windows for the most common agents, depending upon their putative mechanism of action and the type of procedure received.\\nNoncavitary torso bleeding is a rare and potentially lethal form of noncompressible traumatic injury, which seems to affect older patients with more severe comorbidities that sustain localized, high-energy blunt trauma. Typical clinical findings include evidence of ongoing bleeding (up to and including hemorrhagic shock), with a large area of discoloration and/or bruising and many times a palpable mass. Use of anticoagulant medication is usually found during detailed anamnesis. A high index of suspicion and prompt directed therapy are required to have positive outcomes. The level of expertise required is not usually available outside of trauma centers in the rural areas, which adds to the raison d'être of trauma networks. More research is needed to clarify the optimal timing for reinitiating anticoagulation.\\nAll the data collected for the work is depicted in the manuscript.\", \"In the Republic of Ireland, maternity services are highly centralised compared with other countries. All 19 maternity units are in public ownership with no remaining private maternity hospitals and only a small number of planned home deliveries [1] . The hospital maternity services are funded by a hybrid of government funding through the Health Services Executive and through private health insurance (PHI).\\nIn the capital city Dublin, there are three large stand-alone maternity university hospitals where more than 8000 women are delivered in each hospital annually [2] . All three hospitals accept women without differentiation from all socioeconomic groups. There are no catchment areas, and women living in the capital or outside can exercise their choice as to what hospital they wish to attend.\\nAll three hospitals provide three packages of maternity care: public, semi-private, and private. All women are entitled to free public care which is funded by the government based on an annual service level agreement. Outpatient and inpatient services before and after delivery are provided without charge for the woman and her baby by the same team of obstetricians and midwives. Women may also choose semi-private or private care. Almost always, women choosing these models of care have PHI which covers all their hospital costs and part of their medical fees.\\nDespite government funding of the health services, a large proportion of the adult population in the Republic of Ireland takes out PHI [3] . The reasons for this vary depending on the individual, but privately, there is usually quicker access to services, particularly elective services, a wider choice of individual specialists with better continuity of care and access to better facilities in both public and private hospitals [3, 4] .\\nFrom 1994 onwards, Ireland enjoyed rapid economic growth in which time unemployment decreased and the number of people taking out PHI increased to a peak in 2008 at 50.9% of the population [3, 5, 6] . It was in 2008 that the collapse of the Lehman Brothers Bank triggered a major banking crisis in which the government intervened with a 3-year programme restructuring the banking sector. During this Great Recession (2008-2012), unemployment rose but stabilised at 15.9% [7] . From 2009, the percentage of the population taking out PHI linearly decreased to its lowest point of 43.4% in 2014. It has since recovered to 45.4% in 2018 [6] .\\nThe purpose of this longitudinal study was to analyse the trends in private maternity care in a large university hospital in Ireland's capital city from 2009 to 2017, during and after the Great Economic Recession.\\nThis study used the data collected at the first antenatal appointment (usually about 12 weeks gestation) in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. The data are routinely collected and computerised using a barcode system by trained midwives as part of medical records. Data are updated following delivery and before discharge from the hospital. The system used to collect the data has standardised question and answer fields that remained unchanged over the study period. The hospital is one of the largest in Europe, and although based in the southwest of the city, it receives women from both rural and urban areas and all socioeconomic backgrounds. About one in every eight births nationally delivers in the hospital, and its population is broadly representative of the national obstetric population [2, 8, 9] .\\nThe study included all women with a singleton pregnancy who attended for maternity care between the years 2009 and 2017 resulting in a live birth ≥ 500 g or a stillbirth at 20 weeks gestation or later. The data collected at the first antenatal visit included age, parity, employment status, marital status, pregnancy intention, nationality, psychiatric history, psychiatric medications, previous clinical data such as miscarriage history, and lifestyle data including current maternal smoking status. Height and weight were measured by a midwife at the first antenatal visit and recorded to one decimal place before the body mass index (BMI) was calculated.\\nThe variable of interest in this study was the package of care and was categorised as 'private,' semi-private,' and 'public' as previously described. All women are entitled to free maternity care, and for this reason, the public package of care is the most dominant in Ireland. Public care is provided by a senior obstetrician and shared among a team of doctors, midwives, other healthcare professionals, and general practitioners. Any inpatient care antenatally or in the postnatal period is provided on the public ward [10] . Midwives and student midwives usually provide care to the woman during labour and birth with supervision provided by an obstetrician. Semi-private care differs in that antenatal and postnatal care may be provided in a private room subject to availability.\\nPrivate care is a consultant-provided package whereby the women chooses to attend the same consultant obstetrician in their private consulting rooms on an ongoing basis throughout her pregnancy and in the postnatal period. Inpatient care is provided in a private room subject to availability. Per diem payments are required for hospital accommodation. Medical fees are paid for using a combination of PHI and patient copayments. Irrespective of the package of care, all women are delivered in the same labour ward and operating theatres and are cared for by the same staff.\\nThe data were analysed using the statistical software programme SPSS version 24.0 and the online statistical programme Vassarstats [11] . The data were checked for normality using the visual inspections of histograms, skewness and kurtosis values, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test statistic. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the characteristics and the changes in private care over the 9 years. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between the package of care and the maternal characteristics and the lifestyle factors. The regression model was adjusted for age, parity, BMI, maternal occupation, marital status, pregnancy intention, nationality, history of miscarriage smoking status, and psychological history and medication use. The study was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (4-2013). Table 1 shows the study population analysed by the package of maternity care. Overall, 75.2% of the 73,266 women chose the public package, 10.8% chose the semi-private package, and 14.0% chose the private package over the 9 years. The mean age was 31.3 ± 5.6 years, 40.1% were nulliparas, and \\nOverall reference group: Public n = 55,072\\nAll variables included in the tables were mutually adjusted for in the regression analyses a p < 0.001; b p < 0.01; c p < 0.05. Missing data: ∞ n = 541, *n = 57,^n = 50, $ n = 33~n = 9 70.3% were Irish-born. Compared with public patients, women choosing the private package of care were more likely to be older, Irish-born, married, to be in professional/managerial employment, to be a non-smoker, to have planned their pregnancy, and to have a history of infertility or miscarriage ( Table 2) . Table 3 shows the trends in the number of women choosing the three different packages of care annually over the 9 years. Compared with 2009, there was a 21.6% decrease in the number of women attending privately and a 35.3% decrease in the number of women attending semi-privately. As a result, the number of women attending publicly increased by 12.3%. There was a once-off increase in private patients in 2014 due to the transfer of patients from the country's only remaining private maternity hospital which closed suddenly in January of that year.\\nThese trends were observed across all parity, employment, and age categories (Tables 4, 5, and 6). The number of nulliparas opting for public care increased from 73.4% in 2009 to 77.8% in 2017, whereas the numbers of nulliparas opting for semi-private or private care decreased by 21.1% and 11.6%, respectively. Overall, more multiparas consistently opted for private care than nulliparas over the 9 years. However, there was a greater overall decrease in the numbers of multiparas opting for private care by 2017 (26.7%) and a greater increase in those opting for public care compared with nulliparas (Table 4 ). Despite an association between professional/managerial employment and private care, the proportions of women in this class attending privately decreased by almost a third between 2009 and 2017 ( Table 5) . Over three times the number of women aged ≥ 35 years choose private care compared to those aged < 35 years; however, the numbers of women aged ≥ 35 years choosing private care decreased by almost 30% (Table 6) .\\nWomen who delivered successive pregnancies in the hospital were identified. A total of 11,991 delivered twice, 2375 delivered three times, and 235 women delivered four times over the 9-year study period. The majority of women who delivered twice attended for antenatal care in their first pregnancy before 2013 (79.7%). Analysing the deliveries longitudinally, 89.3% (n = 10,757) of 11,991 women opted for the same package of care in the second pregnancy as in their first (Table 7) . Of the women who delivered twice, 85.5% retained a private package of care in their second pregnancy, whereas 7.4% changed to semi-private, and 1.7%, to public. Of the women who delivered three and four times, 84.4% and 84.2% retained private health insurance from their first pregnancy respectively.\\nThis observational study found that the Great Economic Recession in the Republic of Ireland was accompanied with a decrease in demand for the private and semi-private packages of maternity care and an increase in the demand for publicly funded maternity care. However, despite economic recovery and an increase in both male and female employment rates nationally, the demand for private and semi-private packages of care did not recover. The longitudinal analysis showed also that women who choose private care in their first pregnancy usually opted for private care in their subsequent pregnancies, and, likewise, women who choose public care in their first pregnancy usually opted for public care in their subsequent pregnancies.\\nThe Irish health insurance system is based on the key principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover, and minimum benefits [6] . Between 2009 and 2017, there was a significant exodus of younger people from the PHI market from 36 to 30% in the 18-39 years age group [3] . As a result, the Irish Government introduced the Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) loading in 2015 which penalises adults who take out PHI for the first time after 35 years of age [6] . The loading rises steeply again after 45 years of age. In the 19-39year age group, the number of people taking out PHI had fallen from 675,000 in 2009 to 484,000 in 2014 [6] . The LCR has resulted in an increase in adults taking out PHI in this age group to 506,000 in 2017. Missing cases in maternal occupation:\\nThe decrease in women choosing private maternity care may be explained in part by the decrease in younger women holding PHI. However, the increase in female employment after the recession and the introduction of the LCR have not been accompanied by an increase in demand for private care. It may be the case that this cohort of women is challenged fiscally by, for example, the costs of mortgages and childcare.\\nIt is interesting, but not surprising, that the largest decrease in women opting for the private package of care were women in the professional or management class. Families in this category may have faced a cut in salary and an increase in income tax during the recession. In contrast, women who were not in employment were less likely to have chosen private care before the recession, and their take home income may have been socially protected as a result of government policies. However, these findings we believe require detailed study.\\nIn May 2018, the Houses of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare (Sláintecare) report was published [12] . It was a unique crossparty political consensus on a major health reform in Ireland. A 10-year-costed plan recommended a whole system reform with a universal single-tier health service where patients are treated solely on the basis of need. Although an Implementation Office was established by the Department of Health, a single-tier system is not imminent, and the health services are currently prioritising the management of the COVID pandemic. No specific recommendations were made in the report for funding maternity services. In an analysis from the ESRI using the hospital discharge data from public hospitals in 2015, public maternity patients accounted for a 6.0% activity share, and private patients, a 1.4% activity share [13] .\\nIn the absence of an increase in per diem charges to private patients, a falling demand in those opting for private care will lead to a decrease in publically funded hospitals' revenue. The growing increase in the demand for the public package of care means that there will be little or no reduction in ongoing hospital costs. As pregnancy and delivery rates are beyond the control of the health services, funding shortages cannot be solved by methods applicable for other services, for example, waiting lists for elective surgery. As there are no private maternity hospitals left in Ireland, removing private maternity practice from public hospitals as proposed by Sláintecare also poses challenges [12] . Given the prohibitive costs of obstetric negligence insurance, it is unlikely that private hospitals will open private inpatient maternity services in the future.\\nIn Ireland, choice is important to women when it comes to maternity care [4, 14] . In particular, they prioritise safety for their baby and the continuity of care over a hospital's facilities. A qualitative paper found that women who choose private care felt an added sense of security in labour due to the continuity of care with their obstetrician [4] . The abolition of the private and semi-private packages of care in public hospitals would deny women who have been paying PHI, perhaps for many years, of choice. It is notable in our study that the continuity of care packages was maintained from one pregnancy to the next. Younger women who pay PHI are generally healthy, and the national policy of community rating means that younger subscribers to PHI subsidise older subscribers [6] . A recent Irish study has shown decreasing percentages of 'very healthy' and 'healthy' women with PHI coverage between 2009 and 2017 [3] . Despite the LCR, the absence of benefits for maternity care may lead to a further exodus from PHI of younger, healthy subscribers who face more immediate financial demands.\\nThe Great Economic Recession and subsequent recovery had a dramatic impact on Ireland, which makes it an interesting case study on the link between the economy and the purchasing of PHI [3] . In general, increasing age, higher educational achievement, and higher incomes are associated with increased PHI coverage. This is consistent with our observations in maternity care. However, it is notable that the recession and the increase in unemployment rates nationally were associated with a decrease in demand for private and semiprivate care and that the subsequent recovery and decrease in unemployment rates has not seen a decrease in women opting for public care. It also remains to be seen what impact the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated acute economic recession will have on maternity services over the next decade.\\nThis study has strengths. The clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were recorded at the first antenatal visit by a trained midwife in a standardised way over 9 years. The hospital population is large and broadly representative of the national obstetric population [2] . Due to the large sample size and pseudoanonymisation of the study subjects, we were able to analyse the data of women who delivered more than once over time and analyse the changes in packages of maternity care from one pregnancy to the next.\\nA potential weakness is that we do not have information on which women had private health insurance but chose not to opt for a private package of care. In addition, the semi-private package of care is unique to the three large Dublin maternity hospitals and is not available outside the capital. Nonetheless, the increase in demand for public care is likely to have been replicated in the 16 other maternity hospitals nationally.\\nThis detailed analysis on annual trends in the demands for the different packages of maternity care in a large hospital in Ireland's capital provides information that should help shape the implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and the Sláintecare Report [12, 15] . In particular, it demonstrates that future enrolment in PHI, and the demands for private maternity care cannot be modelled based on the rates of female employment alone.\", 'Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae and is a single stranded RNA virus with three major structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (Lai, 1990) . Studies on the pathogenesis of FIPV in both domestic and exotic cats have demonstrated that an acute, fulminant disease (so-called \"wet\" or \"effusive\" FIP) can occur on challenge of seropositive cats as compared with a milder response (so-called \"dry\" or \"non-effusive\" FIP) in seronegative cats (for a review see Pedersen, 1983) . It is believed that the presence of pre-existing antibody leads to either immune complex deposition (Jacobese-Geels, Daha and Horzinek, 1982) or antibodydependent enhancement of macrophage infection upon challenge by FIPV (Olsen, Corapi, Ngichabe, Baines and Scott, 1992) . Therefore, naturally and experimentally ini~cted domestic cats develop lesions with a marked variation in intensity, depending on the cat\\'s antibody status.\\nThe lesions in domestic cats infected with FIPV are of perivascular necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation and fibrinous serositis with FIPV particles present within macrophages in these lesions (Weiss and Scott, 1981 b). Similar lesions have been reported in a number of exotic cats kept in zoological gardens (Colly, 1973) ; however, they have not been previously reported in the European wildcat. A serological survey of freeliving European wildcats in Great Britain did not detect any animals seropositive for FIPV (McOrist, Bold, Jones, Easterbee, Hubbard and Jarrett, 1991) . This study provided an opportunity to examine the pathological and epidemiological features of naturally occurring infectious peritonitis in a closed colony of European wildcats.\\nThe European wildcat (Fells silvestris) colony was housed in a single enclosure exhibit 15 m × 8m × 3 m, at a Scottish Zoological Garden, from 1978 to 1992. The two founder wildcats were purchased from the same source in 1976, placed in this enclosure and had their first litter in 1978. There were no further introductions. Their diet was fresh horse or chicken meat. The details of the size and dates of litter births, and dates of deaths in the colony are given in Fig. 1 . Between 1982 and 1992 necropsies were performed on 17 animals. The major clinical signs (if any) reported in the five wildcats subsequently diagnosed as having infectious peritonitis included nervous signs (three of five) and weight loss (three of five), respiratory signs (two of five) and abdominal distension (two of five). No cats with clinical FIP survived the disease.\\nSelected tissues were fixed in buffered neutral formalin and were routinely processed to paraffin wax for histopathological examination. Sections were routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Immunocytochemical localization of FIPV antigen in paraffit>embedded tissues was demonstrated by an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method (Vectastain, Vector Lab, U.S.A.) alter pre-digestion of the de-waxed sections with 1 per cent trypsin solution [\\'or Anti-FIPV nucleocapsid goat serum was used as a primary antibody at a dilution of 1 in 50. In addition to this indirect antibody detection system, serum from a domestic cat, confirmed as suffering from infectious peritonitis at necropsy, was biotinylated and then used in a separate avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method.\\nTissues from three healthy cats and from cats suffering from parasitic pneumonia were used to provide sections containing uninfected macrophages. Normal goat serum was used as a serum control for the indirect staining techniques.\\nLesions were noted in the liver, kidneys, intestine, brain, lungs, heart and lymphoid tissues. Despite the numerous deaths in young kittens indicated in Fig. 1 , no conclusive evidence of any specific process was detected on examination and a presumptive diagnosis of \"fading kitten syndrome\" was made.\\nIn cats dying of infectious peritonitis in 1982 or 1986 (see Fig. 1 ), there were rnacroscopical lesions in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, with ill-defined areas (up to 5 cm long) of thickening of the wall of the intestine, and of the surface of the liver and pleura, by soft, fawn-coloured tissue. These cavities contained variable amounts (5 to 50 ml) of thick, flocculated, red-brown fluid. There was also patchy lung consolidation.\\nIn cats dying of infectious peritonitis in 1991 or 1992, macroscopical lesions were noted in the liver and kidney. There was firm, diffuse, pale degenerative parenchyma with thickened, fibrous serosal surfaces. No gross brain lesions were detected.\\nHistologically, there were lesions of the serosa and blood vessels in all cats. The serosal surfaces of the liver, spleen, intestine, heart and lungs were markedly thickened with fibrin deposition and a diffuse leucocytic infiltration consisting mostly of neutrophils, with some macrophages and lymphocytes. In cats dying in 1991 or 1992 the thickening consisted offibrovascular granulation tissue, with infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Blood vessels, particularly medium sized arteries and veins, showed marked thickening &the tunica adventitia, with infiltration ofmacrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Other lesions were present in the parenchyma of the lung and liver. In the lung parenchyma of the cat dying in 1992 there was acute inflammation of alveoli with marked intra-alveolar haemorrhage. Numerous macrophages were present in alveolar and bronchiolar lumina and there were marginated mononuclear cells in the pulmonary veins and arterioles. In the hepatic parenchyma of this animal there were apparently sequential stages of hepatic necrosis which originated with loci ofhepatocyte syncytium formation (with no local inflammatory response) and progressed to loci of necrosis with neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2) .\\nVascular lesions were marked in the liver and intestinal serosa &all cats, and the kidneys, lungs, meninges, heart muscle and pericardium of cats dying in 1991 or 1992. hnmunohislochemist~y FIPV antigen was observed in immunohistological preparations in macrophages in lesions from all cats. FIPV antigen-positive macrophages were particularly apparent in the pulmonary (alveolar macrophages), serosal and vascular lesions (see Fig. 3 ). In lung, antigen-positive macrophages were associated with areas of acute inflammation and haemorrhage and were present in both alveoli and bronchioles. The proportion of positive cells varied throughout the lesions, in some areas reaching over 90 per cent of potential target cells. Positive cells were present adherent to vascular endothelium in both arterioles and veins. Few positive cells were seen in the pulmonary interstitium or in peribronchial or peribronchiolar tissues, the majority of positive ceils being located in airway or alveolar lumina or adherent to vascular endothelium. In hepatic parenchyma occasional hepatocytes and hepatocyte syncytia stained positively, with no evidence of viral antigen in adjacent macrophages. As these lesions became necrotic the hepatocyte staining became less intense and antigen became localized in macrophages in the lesion.\\nNo FIPV antigen was detected in tissues from healthy cats or cats with parasitic pneumonia.\\nThis study indicated that an exotic cat, closely related to the domestic cat, was susceptible to FIP, and that the type of lesions seen in an extended outbreak in a closed colony varied with time, probably depending on the immune status of affected animals. Early in the outbreak, European wildcats developed an acute, effusive \"wet\" form of infectious peritonitis, whereas in the later years of the outbreak, chronic \"dry\" lesions of peritonitis produced a debilitating form of the disease with nervous signs present in some animals due to meningeal vasculitis. This study was the first to use immunohistochemistry to locate FIPV antigen in exotic cats and the distribution of antigen detected was similar to that recorded in FIPV infection of domestic cats (Weiss and Scott, 1981 a,b) . Therelbre the similarity of clinical and pathological features in these exotic cats affected with infectious peritonitis to those seen in domestic cats was probably due to the viral infection of macrophages and consequent development of lesions occurring in a similar manner. Also, the alteration in the type of lesion over the 10-year outbreak indicated that the immune status of the individuals varied with their age, as animals dying of the \"wet\" form of FIP early in the outbreak were 3 and 7 years old and those dying later in the outbreak of\"dry\" FIP were 9 or l0 years old. This may also reflect a difference in the incubation times of the two forrns of the disease.\\nThe source of the virus could not be determined in this outbreak. The design of the enclosure made contact with domestic cats unlikely. It is possible that a virus-positive carrier may have introduced the virus and been the mechanism by which the virus persisted in the colony over a period of 10 years. Coronaviruses related to FIPV can be present in lkline faeces (Pedersen, Boyle, Floyd, Fudge and Baker, 1981) period of the \"dry\" FIP may be several months, affected animals may harbour and shed virus for some time before developing clinical signs and dying. Interestingly, all the animals that died of confirmed FIP were male, despite approximately equal (10 vs 12) numbers of male and female offspring in the colony. Apparent increased susceptibility of males has also been noted in domestic cats (Potkay, Bacher and Pitts, 1974; Robinson, Holzworth and Gilmore, 1971) , although other studies have shown no particular sex predisposition (Pedersen, 1976) . In the outbreak in a domestic cat colony reported by Potkay and colleagues a seasonal incidence of deaths due to FIP was noticed, with most occurring during the winter months. Similarly, in this colony four of the five deaths occurred between October and March. The reason for this is unclear although \"stress\" factors of temperature variation have been suggested. Poor neonatal survival of kittens was also a problem in this colony, seven of 22 kittens having died within one month of birth. Although none of these deaths were closely investigated this type of syndrome has been associated with FIPV infection (McKiernan, Evermann, Hargis, Miller and Ott, 1981) .\\nThe major target for FIP infection is the macrophage but we lbund that hcpatocytes may also be infected. In this study lesions due to hepatocyte infection were the earliest changes detectable in the liver, with syncytium formation and necrosis. These lesions were analogous to those caused by another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (Blackmore, Guillon and Schwanzer, 1981) . Macrophages in the liver of the wildcats, including Kupffer cells, were also infected with the virus. As virus is rarely found free in the blood a cell-borne transmission to the hepatocyte is likely, probably via the Kupffer cells. The frequency of infection ofnon-macrophage cells in other organs is not known but was not common in this study.', 'Since January of 2020, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has swept across the United States, resulting in more than 522,973 deaths as of 8 March 2021 [1] . Global research initiatives to determine optimal clinical management strategies are ongoing, but much remains unknown. To improve public health, the White House executed Operation Warp Speed in March 2020, which promoted the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines by selected pharmaceuticals in order to accelerate the development of novel therapeutic agents to aid the response to this pandemic throughout the country [2] . Despite the efforts to release a COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner, a Reuters poll conducted in May 2020 demonstrated that one-fourth of Americans were uninterested in getting the coronavirus vaccine once available. The common reasons included nervousness about the vaccine\\'s quick approval and weariness about the risk associated with a new vaccine [3] . It is important to note that the general public\\'s knowledge regarding COVID-19 may have been influenced by myths circulating on social media [4] . However, another survey revealed that participants were more willing to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination [5] . Pharmacists are on the frontline of mass immunization efforts and play a vital role in recommending vaccines to improve public health. This involvement also makes pharmacists at increased risk for exposure, thus, emphasizing the importance to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The Department of Health and Human Services authorized pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 vaccines under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act [6] . Previous research has shown that healthcare providers with high confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines were more likely to accept vaccines for themselves and recommend vaccines to their patients [7] .\\nIn April 2020, there were 78 active COVID-19 vaccine candidates. These vaccine candidates include the Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. mRNA vaccine platforms and the Janssen viral vector vaccine platform [8] . The preliminary updates on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in phase III clinical trials may have influenced many pharmacists\\' perceptions within a short period of time. In a survey conducted among 400 pharmacists in November 2020, 52% of pharmacists were ready to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, 74% were willing to administer the vaccine as soon as possible, and 37% were willing to receive and vaccinate patients as soon as possible [9] . In December 2020, the FDA\\'s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) approved the United States\\' first COVID-19 vaccines Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submitted by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. [10, 11] . On 27 February 2021 the FDA\\'s VRBPAC approved the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine under emergency use authorization [12] . The COVID-19 vaccine global landscape continues to expand-with 108 vaccines in clinical development and 3 vaccines approved for emergency-use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States as of 15 July 2021 [13] .\\nIt is crucial for pharmacists to stay informed on COVID-19 vaccines\\' safety and efficacy data to address vaccine hesitancy so that their patients can feel comfortable in deciding to receive the vaccine. Through this study, we aim to assess how clinical information, background training, and personal experience with COVID-19, as well as how pharmacists\\' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes influence their perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccines. The objective of this study was to assess what factors influence pharmacists\\' willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines and to identify pertinent information that pharmacists need to make an informed decision to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines.\\nThis was a national cross-sectional study administered with use of the secure online survey platform, Qualtrics. A convenience sample of voluntary participants were recruited nationally through email-and listserv-based distribution, utilizing publicly accessible contact lists in pharmacy professional organization listservs and professional social media platforms such as LinkedIn. The professional organization listservs that were used include Rutgers pharmacy preceptors, Rutgers Pharmaceutical Industry Fellowship (RPIF) current fellows and alumni, Garden State Pharmacy Owners, New Jersey Society of Health-System Pharmacists (NJSHP), American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP), and American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP). Once participants agreed with the informed consent form, they were able to access the 34-question survey. The survey was open on 18 September 2020 and closed on 16 November 2020. This survey data was collected prior to any preliminary COVID-19 vaccine data.\\nAny licensed U.S. pharmacist from various settings was able to participate. The exclusion criteria included pharmacy technicians, interns, externs, and non-pharmacy licensed subjects. Participants were excluded from analysis if they did not consent to the survey, were not a practicing pharmacist in the USA, completed ≤ 15% of the survey, or did not respond to the questions corresponding to the primary outcome. The study variables collected were parameters in the form of yes/no questions, select all that apply, and ordinal scale ranking. The independent variables collected were demographics, exposure to COVID-19, work type, likelihood to receive a vaccine, likelihood to recommend a vaccine, concerns of vaccine safety, concerns of vaccine efficacy, and prioritization of vaccine information.\\nThe primary outcomes were the pharmacists\\' willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines. This was assessed using Questions 22, 23, 26, and 27 (Table S1 and the use of a Likert scale). We created a binary variable indicating willingness to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine for \"somewhat likely\" or \\'extremely likely\" responses.\\nPharmacists\\' willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines were assessed at ≤ 1 year from the time of vaccine approval and > 1 year from the time of vaccine approval. Covariates assessed in the survey included COVID-19 exposure or personal experience, primary pharmacy practice setting, background in training, region of the United States, and prioritization of clinical data. Pharmacists\\' perceptions of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines were also assessed. Further exploratory analyses were done to assess concordance and discordance among pharmacists\\' decisions to receive and recommend using Questions 22, 23, 26, and 27 (Table S1) .\\nThis survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rutgers University and data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The p-values were determined using a chi-squared analysis. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA).\\nA total of 763 participants responded to the survey, however, only 632 participants were included in the final analysis. A total of 131 participants were excluded because 6 (4.6%) did not consent, 61 (46.6%) were not practicing pharmacists in the USA, 41 (31.3%) completed ≤ 15% of the survey, and 23 (17.6%) of the participants did not answer one or more of the four prime study questions regarding their willingness to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine.\\nCharacteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . The majority of our respondents were from the Northeast region of the USA, female, between 18 and 55 years old, white, worked in a direct patient care setting, and had completed post-doctoral training.\\nPerceptions of COVID-19 and new COVID-19 vaccines were assessed and are presented in Table 2 . The majority of pharmacists were concerned about becoming infected with COVID-19, believed it would affect their daily work, and believed spread was dependent on human control. However, only about half of the pharmacists believed that a COVID-19 vaccine would protect them. Pharmacists\\' willingness to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine were assessed at ≤ 1 year from the time of vaccine approval and > 1 year after vaccine approval, as listed in Table 2 . Pharmacists were significantly more likely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at > 1 year after vaccine approval as compared were ≤ 1 year after vaccine approval. Overall, more than half of the pharmacists were somewhat likely or extremely likely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. Perceptions of COVID-19 and new COVID-19 vaccines were assessed and are presented in Table 3 . The majority of pharmacists were concerned about becoming infected with COVID-19, believed it would affect their daily work, and believed spread was depen-dent on human control. However, only about half of the pharmacists believed that that a COVID-19 vaccine would protect them. A secondary analysis was conducted to determine how consistent individual respondents were in their choice to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines When comparing the responses for vaccine decision-making to receive vs. recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at ≤ 1 year after vaccine approval, significantly more pharmacists were \"somewhat likely or extremely likely,\" to recommend the vaccine than to receive the vaccine (p < 0.0001). Pharmacists\\' concordance between vaccine receival and recommendation status showed that 59.7% of the pharmacists said they were somewhat likely/extremely likely to both receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines and 29.1% of the pharmacists said they were neither likely nor unlikely/somewhat unlikely/or extremely unlikely to both receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines. When assessing discordance, it was found that 3.8% of the pharmacists that said they were \"somewhat likely/extremely likely to recommend the vaccine\" but answered that they were \"neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat unlikely, or strongly unlikely,\" to receive the vaccine themselves at ≤ 1 year from time of vaccine approval.\\nA comparison of responses for vaccine decision-making to receive a COVID-19 vaccine vs. to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine was also completed at > 1 year after vaccine approval. There was a statistically significant difference when pharmacists were asked if they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine vs. recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at > 1 year after vaccine approval (p < 0.0001). Pharmacists\\' concordance between vaccine receival and recommendation status >1 year after vaccine approval showed that 72.8% of the pharmacists said they were \"somewhat likely/extremely likely to both receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines\" and 13.6% of the pharmacists said they were \"neither likely nor unlikely/somewhat unlikely/or extremely unlikely to both receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines\". When assessing discordance, it was found that 8.4% of the pharmacists that said they would \"somewhat agree or strongly agree,\" to recommend the vaccine, but answered that they were \"neither likely nor likely, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree,\" to receive the vaccine themselves >1 year after vaccine approval.\\nPotential factors that may influence pharmacists\\' decision to receive a COVID-19 vaccine are illustrated in Table 4 . There was a significant difference (p < 0.0001) between collective responses of each of the five categories (extremely unlikely, somewhat unlikely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat likely, and extremely likely) at ≤ 1 year and > 1 year after vaccine approval. * All data presented as n (%) unless otherwise specified. ** The option of \"unsure,\" was not an available answer choice for the following question. *** p-value compares the somewhat likely, extremely likely at ≤ 1 year vs. > 1 year from vaccine approval.\\nPotential factors that may influence pharmacists\\' decision to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine are illustrated in Table 5 . There was a significant difference (p < 0.0001) between collective responses of each of the five categories (extremely unlikely, somewhat unlikely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat likely, extremely likely) at ≤ 1 year and > 1 year after vaccine approval. * All data presented as n (%) unless otherwise specified. ** The option of \"unsure,\" was not an available answer choice for the following question. *** p-value compares the somewhat likely, extremely likely at ≤ 1 year vs. > 1 year from vaccine approval.\\nIf participants chose \"neither unlikely nor likely, somewhat unlikely, or extremely unlikely,\" to either receive or recommend COVID-19 vaccines they were then asked to select all reasons for why they would delay or refuse a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of time of vaccine approval. Participants who said they would delay or refuse receiving a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 253) chose to do so for the following reasons: concerns about side effects or sickness (81%), rapidly changing real world data during pandemic (46.6%), not in a high-risk or priority group (23.7%), belief that the vaccine does not work (23.3%), limited contact with high-risk patients (12.6%), ability to social distance and wear a mask provides sufficient protection (5.5%), COVID-19 is non-severe or temporary issue (3.2%), vaccine candidate already had COVID-19 (0.8%), COVID-19 vaccination is not needed nor wanted (6.3%), and other (28.9%). If participants chose \"somewhat agree or strongly agree,\" to any of Question 23, 24, 26, or 27, then, they were asked to select all reasons they chose to receive or recommend the vaccine. Participants who said they would delay or refuse recommending a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 253) to their patients, chose to do so for the following reasons: concerns about side effects or sickness (75.1%), rapidly changing real world data during pandemic (41.1%), belief that the vaccine does not work (17%), not in a high-risk or priority group (15%), limited contact with high-risk patients (9.5%), hesitant about vaccine discussion with patients (9.1%), ability to social distance and wear a mask provides sufficient protection (4.7%), vaccine candidate already had COVID-19 (4.7%), COVID-19 is a non-severe or temporary issue (2%), other (20.6%). Concerns that fell under the \"other,\" category included political influence on vaccine approval, and uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy data, and fear that the approval process would be too quick or compromise safety.\\nIf participants chose \"somewhat likely or extremely likely,\" to either receive or recommend COVID-19 vaccines. Then, they were asked to select all reasons why they were in favor of the COVID-19 vaccine. Among those who favored the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (n = 565), the following reasons included: avoid transmitting COVID-19 to family (91.9%), reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 to protect self (87.6%), being a healthcare worker (80%), avoid transmitting COVID-19 to community or patients (64.1%), workplace mandate (47.6%), recommendations of government health agencies (43.5%), recommendation from other medical professionals (40.4%), have a medical condition that puts vaccine candidate at increased risk for COVID-19 (12.9%), recommendations of friends and family (9%), recommendations of political leaders (1.8%), other (41.6%). Among those who favored recommending the COVID-19 vaccine to their patients (n = 537), the following reasons included: reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 to protect self (94.2%), avoid transmitting COVID-19 to family (90.5%), avoid transmitting COVID-19 to community or patients (90.3%), patient has a medical condition that puts them at increased risk for COVID-19 (86%), recommendations of government health agencies (62.9%), recommendations of political leaders (2.2%), and other (1.7%).\\nRegardless of the pharmacists\\' decision to receive or recommend vaccination, all respondents were asked to prioritize the top three clinical pieces of clinical information they would prioritize when formulating a decision to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. The prioritization of this clinical information is shown in Figure 1 . \\nTo date, this is the largest survey study to report the results of pharmacists\\' perceptions of and willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines during a global pandemic. A previous study conducted by Petek et al. showed that familiarity with influenza disease did not impact the decision to vaccinate for influenza [14] . Pharmacists\\' perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed to gauge if the rapidly changing knowledge of the disease state would influence pharmacists\\' view of credibility for a new vaccine. Our study found that 67.1% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 63.4% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine at ≤ 1 year from the time of vaccine approval. At > 1 year after vaccine approval, 78% of the pharmacists were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 81.2% of the pharmacists were willing to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. There was a significant difference in pharmacists\\' vaccine decisions between the varying time frame of vaccine approval. Pharmacists with post-doctoral training were more likely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those without post-doctoral training. Pharmacists in indirect patient care settings were more likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those in direct patient care settings. Lastly, pharmacists with increased personal experience and exposure to COVID-19 were more likely than unlikely to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. Pharmacist with no post-doctoral training were less likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those with post-doctoral training. Pharmacist in direct patient care settings were less likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine than those indirect patient care settings. Pharmacist without personal experience nor exposure to COVID-19 were more unlikely than likely to receive or recommend a COVID-19 vaccine. These determinants may aid in identifying current concerns of pharmacists so that medical education may be tailored to address those concerns.\\nOur results were consistent with the results of another nationwide survey of 400 pharmacists conducted by the American Pharmacist Association (APhA) from 21 November 2020 to 28 November 2020. The survey conducted by APhA showed that 69% of pharmacists would receive a COVID-19 vaccine at ≤ 1 year and 60% of pharmacists would recommend the vaccine at ≤ 1 year [9] . The APhA survey was conducted shortly after preliminary results for COVID-19 vaccines efficacy trials were published [15, 16] . Our survey was conducted from 19 September 2020 to 18 November 2020 (prior to release of any COVID-19 vaccine trial data) and showed that baseline willingness status of pharmacists to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines were similar to their willingness status once the preliminary clinical trial findings were released. A major difference between our study and the survey conducted by APhA is that the APhA survey assessed pharmacists\\' willingness at three different time intervals: vaccination as soon as possible, after six months of experience with the vaccine, and after one year of experience with the vaccine. Although we assessed willingness at ≤ 1 year and > 1 year of vaccine approval, this difference between studies may be negligible in a real-world setting. COVID-19 vaccine distribution is decided by phases recommend by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; therefore, recipients may not have the ability to choose when they will receive the vaccine within the first year of vaccine roll-out. The APhA survey also assessed how prepared pharmacist felt to administer COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available. Pharmacists had the option of stating the following: they are ready to receive and vaccinate as soon as the vaccine is available, they are in the final preparation stages and are ready to vaccinate patients as soon as the vaccine is available, they are not prepared to vaccinate in the first wave of the vaccination effort but plan to participate in future phases, or logistics of preparation are too difficult for them to participate [9] . This is a component that our survey did not assess but would be useful to determine what resources pharmacists need to feel prepared, in order to increase their willingness to receive and recommend vaccines.\\nPrevious research has found that 69% of the general U.S. population were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Reiter et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey which consisted of 2006 adults ages 18 and older during May 2020. Reiter et al. demonstrated that participants were more likely to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination. The general U.S. population was also more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived risk of being infected by COVID-19, or perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. The results from the general adult U.S. population also revealed that participants were less likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were non-Latinx Black or had higher levels of perceived potential vaccine harm [5] . The rate of willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was comparable to other studies done surveying the general adult population [5] . Since the general adult population consider healthcare providers as a major influencer in their vaccine decision, the need to increase pharmacists\\' confidence and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is evident. We also did not analyze how willingness toward vaccination differed between race, although this may be important for future findings to address perceptions as they relate to health disparities.\\nAn online survey of U.S. adults observed trends in vaccine trust and vaccine hesitancy between 14 October 2020 and 29 March 2021. Daly et al. surveyed 7420 participants who provided 42,154 survey responses. U.S adults showed that overall vaccine hesitancy has declined significantly by 10.8% from October 2020 (46%) to March 2021 (35.2%). U.S. adults were asked to rate their trust for the \"governmental approval process to ensure the COVID-19 vaccine is safe for the public,\" and the \"process in general (not just for COVID-19) to develop safe vaccines for the public,\" on a scale of one (fully trust) to four (do not trust). Change in trust increased by 0.4 from October 2020 (3.0) to March 2021 (2.6) [17] . Since our survey was conducted before vaccine data showed high efficacy against COVID-19, there is a need to conduct a survey of pharmacists\\' trust and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the USA, now that COVID-19 vaccines have regulatory approval and the existence of mass immunization programs.\\nResearch is still needed to understand how U.S. pharmacists\\' readiness to provide COVID-19 services impacts their willingness to provide COVID-19 vaccination. Merks et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey that consisted of 1777 Polish community pharmacist between February and August 2020. Merks et al. assessed the readiness and willingness of pharmacists, trained and not trained through a pilot immunization workshop, to provide vaccination services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Polish community pharmacists who underwent additional immunization training showed a greater readiness to provide immunization services as compared with those who did not receive training. The most common barriers affecting Polish pharmacists\\' readiness were: providing vaccinations will require more work, not enough training courses, and pharmacy facilities are not adjusted to provide these services [18] . Acknowledging that readiness and willingness for vaccination are not mutually exclusive, our findings were comparable in showing that those who have completed additional training were more likely than unlikely to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines. This may emphasize the effects of educational training on vaccine acceptance. Our study did not analyze what resources are needed to overcome vaccine hesitancy in pharmacists or barriers in vaccine implementation in pharmacy practice settings.\\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, the use of a convenience sample may have allowed for possible selection bias in regard to survey distribution. According to the Bureau Labor of Statistics, 42% of the pharmacy graduates work in a community practice setting and 26% of the pharmacy graduates work in a hospital practice setting, therefore, our study population is not representative of the pharmacist workforce data in the United States [19] . Moreover, there was no standardized denominator to accurately determine the survey response rates given the broad distribution across online platforms and email distribution lists from professional organizations. Lastly, our survey took place before multiple companies filed for the FDA Emergency Use Authorization which publicized thẽ 95% effectiveness clinical trial data [14, 15] . This vaccine data could certainly affect the perceptions of pharmacists toward COVID-19 vaccines and the current survey findings may change based on the now available data.\\nHowever, a potential strength of our data is that it was taken before the interim COVID-19 vaccine results and can be viewed as pharmacists\\' unbiased baseline perceptions. Our data represents how pharmacists feel at baseline and how pharmacists are influenced prior to release of vaccines emergency use authorization. This not only informs the current pandemic, but future ones as well. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest survey assessing pharmacist personal and professional behaviors regarding future COVID-19 vaccines. There were survey respondents across the country as well as across specialty areas and practice settings.\\nVaccines are among the most effective public health interventions worldwide. By understanding possible determinants in vaccine decision-making, we should be able to further tailor vaccine education and understand barriers to vaccine acceptance. Further research is needed on both health behaviors and vaccine confidence among healthcare professionals, as well as clinical decision-making in areas of novel therapeutics.\\nThis cross-sectional survey was conducted from September to November 2020 (prior to the release of any COVID-19 vaccine trial data) but during the time governing bodies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and the White House issued COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization guidance. Pharmacists, as members of the front-line immunization effort, play a vital role in recommending and providing vaccines to improve public health. We aimed to assess pharmacists\\' willingness to receive and recommend COVID-19 vaccines and factors that may influence this decision. Our study showed that although most pharmacists would receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine, a substantial proportion of pharmacists reports vaccine hesitancy to receive or recommend COVID-19 vaccines. Pharmacists prioritize similar clinical information when considering the decision to receive and recommend a COVID-19 vaccine.\\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/pharmacy9030131/s1, Table S1 : Survey Questionnaire. Funding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rutgers University (Protocol ID Pro2020002011, date of approval: 18 September 2020).\\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.', '4. The role of ubiquitination and the proteins that regulate it are the focus of Figure 3 . In Figure 3 the control used in figure 3I is 3-MA treatment. First, how much 3-MA was used? Specificity of its inhibition diminishes at higher concentrations above 10uM. The data presented show that 3-MA is not working in this assay, as there is no decrease in long-term protein degradation observed unlike siSKP2 which shows an increase in long-term protein levels when knocked down. Why should 3-MA not show an increase in this experiment? This is the same result in Figure 4D where 3-MA has no effect on protein levels. This is not discussed in the text. Figure 4 , there are several controls missing in the figure. First, there are no toxicity controls showing that the range of each inhibitor used is below significant cell toxicity levels. Secondly, the control in 4D using HBSS as an inducer of autophagy is not shown. Please show experimental evidence that in this experiment HBSS induces autophagy. Third, in 4E, BECN1 levels increase with all drugs; however LC3B increases with only 2 of them, and there doesn\\'t seem to be a change in P62. There should be some correlation between these results but there is no consistency.\\n6. As MERS-CoV infection and proteins are considered for their role in autophagy, there are several conflicting results. First, the figure numbering does not match the text. Secondly, in Figure 5E , for the WCE blot it is not clear how you can observe both SNAP29 and STX17 in the same blot where it does not show up in the IP blots. Shouldn\\'t they be in the same complex since they are crosslinked so they show as 1 band? The order of 5F and G should be reversed. And 5F is not clear. I assume it is a quantitation of 5G, however it does not match the data in 5G. The relationship between ATG14 monomeric and oligomeric forms and autophagy is not made clear. Are there published data showing oliogomeric ATG14 actively inhibits autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or simply that it fails to promote fusion? Also, if MERS is inhibiting oligomerization, I would expect there to be an increase in monomer, which is not seen. Does total ATG14 amount change? Please clarify. figure S3 is also confusing. First, the cropped cells in S3E do not line up, please clean up the cropping. Secondly, there does not seem to be an increase yellow staining and a correlated decrease in red staining in the single cell shown in each panel. This example cell does not correlate with F. Third, the mutant viruses with either 4b or 5 deleted are great, however does the 4b deletion virus still contain the entire 4a coding region or was is 4a ORF effected when 4b was deleted? The oligos are in the methods section but no explanation in the text to the sites of the deletion. There are also no growth curves showing the 2 deletion viruses compared to WT virus. Do they grow equally well in the experiments or are they attenuated in their growth under control conditions? Fourth, the virus output that is examined in K is only looking at mRNA with no statistically significant different noted however it is stated in the text that the SKP2i inhibitor effects MERS growth. The K panel seems to be missing data. And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?\\n8. In the model figure and in the discussion, there is no description of data presented to show the direct effect of SKP2 on ATG14 oligomerization. Since this is a key feature of the model, it would be important to show that SKP2 siRNA or inhibition by drugs effects the ATG14 oligo/monomer relationship.\\nMinor Issues 1. Figure 1B . The whole cell lysates shown in the 2nd and 3rd lane for BECN1 (3rd blot down) are different however they are the same in the IP blot for BECN1 (2nd blot down). Please correct or explain why there are differences.\\nReviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: Gassen et al reported here a very complete study of a novel regulation of autophagy by SKP2, a E3 ubiquitin ligase. They nicely demonstrated that SKP2 targets BECN1, an autophagy protein which is involved in autophagosome formation and maturation in two different complexes. SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins. They identified and studied a pharmacological compound, SMIP004, which strongly inhibits SKP2. The results presented her are novel, technically sound and contribute to a better understanding of autophagy regulation.\\nA second part of the article is dedicated to a possible therapeutic application of their data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. MERS-CoV is a human betacoronavirus responsible of a severe viral respiratory disease, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A third of reported patients with MERS have died and no antiviral treatment is currently available. They first demonstrated that MERS CoV blocks autophagy, in particular the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, using several reliable autophagy monitoring experiments. They identified three nonstructural viral proteins which can recapitulate the block of the autophagic flux observed during viral infection. They constructed recombinant viruses deleted for these genes but unfortunately poorly characterized their phenotype.\\nFinally they tested the effect of this SKP2 inhibitor, SMIP004 at 10µM, on MERS-CoV infection and observed an important inhibition of its multiplication. Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data.\\nIn conclusion, this article reports totally new and important data on both autophagy regulation by SKP2 and on interaction between MERS-CoV and autophagy and a possible antiviral role of autophagy, which can be used as an innovative therapeutic approach.\\nPage 4 \"CoV propagation and immune evasion is highly dependent on the formation of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are reminiscent of autophagosomes (ref 17) pointing to a potential role of autophagy during the CoV life cycle.\" In the introduction the authors improperly and incompletely reported data from the literature regarding impact of autophagy on coronavirus infection. Indeed, the presence of DMVs during Mouse Hepatitis virus infection (another betacoronavirus) has been reported in 2002 in the reference 17 cited by the authors. However, a more recent study, Regiorri et al demonstrated that DMVs are coated with the nonlipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I) and that LC3-II the autophagic marker and autophagy have no role on viral production. This was confirmed in the journal Autophagy by Zhao et al who demonstrated that MHV replication does not require Atg5. Therefore, it is established that autophagy has no role on MHV replication. However, it has been reported that autophagy negatively regulates TGEV replication (Sci Rep 2016). But another study reported a proviral role of autophagy on TGEV (Oncotarget 2016). Indeed, TGEV infection induces mitophagy to promote cell survival and possibly viral infection.\\nPage 11 \"These results points to a block of autophagic flux by MERS-CoV infection at both early (BECN1) and late steps in the pathway\" Whereas data clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection blocks autophagic flux and leads to an accumulation of immature autophagosomes, no evidence demonstrates that early steps of autophagy are reduced by MERS-CoV infection. A decrease of BECN1 expression is not sufficient to conclude this, when in parallel they observed an increase of the total number of autophagic vesicles during infection compared to control cells ( Fig S3F) . In the article (Cottam et al 2014, ref 41), the authors concluded that the non-structural protein nsp6 of IBV, an avian coronavirus, restricts autophagosome expansion by immunofluorescence by measuring the diameter of the autophagosomes. The authors need therefore to modify this sentence.\\nThe results presented in Figure 5 clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV blocks autophagosome maturation rather that initial steps of autophagosome formation. The titer of Figure 5 is therefore not adapted to the results and should be replaced by \"blocks autophagic flux\".\\nPage 15 and Figure 6 panels A and B \"In order to confirm the influence of p4b and p5 on virus replication, we performed loss of…for the step-wise construction of an ORF4b-and ORF5-deleted MERS-CoV\" \"The deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in 10-fold lower replication efficiency 48 hours p.i. (Fig. 6B )\"\\nThe characterization of the recombinant viruses presented in this study is clearly insufficient. No genome sequence analysis was reported. Growth kinetics of the different viruses showing viral titers (pfu/ml) at different times need to be added instead of measuring an inhibitory effect of the deletion ( fig 6B) . More importantly, the authors did not report that in two previous independent studies (ref 44 of this article and Almazan et al, Mbio, 2013), construction of equivalent mutant MERS-CoV (no expression of orf5 or orf4ab) led to different results. Indeed, recombinant viruses lacking orf5 expression replicated to high titers (44). Similarly, Almazan et al observed that virus titers, cpe and plaque morphology of MERS-delta5 are similar to that of parental virus. In the case of MERS-delta4ab the viral titer was only 10 fold lower at 72hpi. How the authors explain this discrepancy? This can be related to an improper way to quantify viral production. Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.\\nPanel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells? If growth kinetics of mutant viruses are similar to that of parental virus, this would allow the authors to confirm the antiviral role of autophagy on MERS-CoV and to reveal a possible requirement of orf4b or orf5 to counteract it.\\nThe titer of the legend does not reflect the results. No data in this figure demonstrates that SKP2 inhibition reduces viral replication.\\nRegarding SKP2 inhibitor, effect on viral replication is impressive, but same remark than above, growth kinetics and determination of viral titers are necessary. Moreover, to prove that the compound is acting via autophagy, effect of SMIP004 should be tested in autophagy deficient cells. This kind of approach was used for antibacterial activity of tat-beclin1 for example, in reference 46, Shoji-Kawata et al Nature 2013.\\nPage 17 ABT-737 and Tat-Beclin both inhibit MERS-CoV replication and they \"leave the levels of BECN1 unchanged\". Therefore, the authors cannot conclude just after that \"increasing BECN1 is the relevant mechanism\". We can make the same remark on page 18, on the mechanism of SKP2 inhibitor by enhancing BECN1 levels. Effects of overexpression of BECN1 on CoV replication should be tested. A siRNA against BECN1 will confirm the involvment of BECN1 and autophagy in CoV replication.\\nThe authors need to report that several of their tested drugs have well-described activity on autophagy, such as niclosamide, valinomycin, salinomycin and gossypol. They only confirmed previous studies. Moreover, these compounds are not only SKP2 inhibitors and specific autophagy inhibitors but have other activities since for example Niclosamide increases mitochondrial fission and valinomycin is a potassium ionophore. Once again, viral replication should be explored using plaque assay and growth kinetics. Figure 7 panels B and C The unusable way to determine the antiviral activity does not valorize the impressive results. Even if all these drugs inhibit SKP2, they have other activities. Therefore, the title needs to be modified unless impact of SKP2 is tested by gene silencing.\\nDiscussion page 21 line 5 Same remark than above, unless they are testing SKP2 knock down, the authors cannot conclude on impact of SKP2 inhibition on viral multiplication. The authors should report in the discussion that autophagy has no antiviral effect on MHV, another betacoronavirus.\\nIn conclusion regarding the antiviral activities the authors clearly identified components able to block MERS-CoV replication but the mechanism by SKP2 inhibition is not so far demonstrated.\\nMinor remarks: Figure 1 \"(C-F) FKP51…. Transfected with vector control… or FKP51\" add (Co) after control Figure 3 panel I Information regarding $$ is missing in the legend. Unfortunate that only LLP degradation was tested with siRNA against SKP2 and no other readout for autophagy such as LC3 of p62.\\nPage 10 \"Targeting SKP2 INCREASED protein degradation\"\\nPage 11 \"we aimed to test if blocking the SKP2 dependent autophagy inhibition influences CoV replication\". To improve the understanding of this sentence, it is better to say \"if stimulation of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitor influences MERS-CoV replication. Add MERS instead of just CoV because, it was tested only for this coronavirus.\\nPage 13-15 Several mistakes in the labelling of panels for figure S3 Page 13 S3DE is S3EF; S3F is in fact S3G, S3G is S3H page 15 S3H is S3I I is J and J is K Moreover in Figure S3K what is the condition \"Co\"? sam question for Figure S5 panel I. where are the white histograms? pages 2 4 15 17 20 22 The word \"propagation\" is used several times in the text, but corresponds in fact to viral cell-to-cell spread and is not tested here. It should be replaced by viral multiplication or production.\\nFinally the title does not totally reflect data presented in the article, because impact of SKP2 on viral replication has been explored only using compounds which have other activities than just inhibiting SKP2.\\nReviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic pathway that can mediate degradation of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins and other cargo like viral components. Being a destructive process, autophagy has to be tightly controlled. Indeed, intricate signalling pathways regulate both induction and flux rates of autophagy. Recent reports have highlighted the impact of autophagy on many cellular processes and its role as an anti-viral mechanism. Gassen et al had previously identified FKBP51 as a beclin-binding protein, which mediates induction of autophagy (Gassen et al, 2014&2015). Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-by-side (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly. A few specific issues need to be addressed as well: Major: 1. Treatment with drugs can have multiple effects on viral replication. Therefore, even though all used drugs presumably target a similar pathway, it has to be made sure that autophagy is responsible for viral attenuation. The authors should conduct experiments in which autophagy is induced (e.g. by mentioned drugs), but the effects of this induction are blocked. For example, can the growth attenuation be rescued if autophagic turnover is blocked by chloroquine, or LC3B conjugation inhibited by ATG5 KO/KD? Furthermore, the chosen drugs used to inhibit SKP2 (even though it is backed up by literature) need direct evidence that SKP2-dependent beclin-1 ubiquitination is reduced. 2. The interesting data on MERS-CoV prompts the question, how do other viruses, which are known to be sensitive towards autophagy, react towards inhibition of SKP2. Experiments exploring the effect of the drugs on e.g. Sindbis Virus or HIV-1 replication should clarify that issue and would complement the MERS-CoV data and make it less focused on treating a single virus with a system potentially applicable for other viral pathogens. 3. Fig. 2C : To show that SKP2 is the E3 ligase which ubiquitinates beclin-1, the authors should include a SKP2 E3-ligase null mutant and monitor beclin-1 levels/degradation. The effect observed in Fig. 2C -F should be rescued by MG132 treatment, to prove its proteasome dependent degradation. 4. Fig. 3 : A few additional details have to be clarified: Is Beclin-1 K402R resistant towards degradation induced by either PHLPPi treatment or SKP2 overexpression? Since AKT1 is involved in the cascade, does pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 lead to stabilization of beclin-1? Minor: 1. The abstract needs rephrasing to emphasise the achievements of this paper in a more cohesive and appealing way. The current abstract undersells the story. 2. The title of the paper could be shortened to sound less convoluted. 3. Writing of the results section (first part) might need improvement to make it more accessible. Furthermore, mechanistic details could be presented more cohesively to focus on the achievements of the paper. 4. Please add size markers to all the western blots. 5. Fig. 1 B: Stabilization of beclin-1 levels by MG132 has to be compared to NH4Cl treatment, to rule out turnover by autophagy. 6. Fig. 2A ,B: It would be interesting to see the whole Western Blots (especially for USP18 and USP36, including the input). 7. Fig. 2C ,D: Since SKP2 is regulated by phosphorylation. It would be curious to see how phosphomimetic and phospho-null mutants of SKP2 would impact beclin-1 stability. 8. Fig. 3 I: Please show one exemplary western blot of a protein degraded by autophagy. 9. Fig. 4 E: Please add a quantification for the western blots as shown in the figure. 10. Fig. 5D and E: Both figure panels could be moved to the supplements, as the effect observed is only marginal and other data presented is stronger. 11. Fig. 6A : While interesting, the sketch could be moved to the supplements. 12. Fig. 6G : Could be moved to the supplements 13. Fig. 6E : While manual counting is certainly being used a lot, these assays could be alternatively quantified using flow cytometry to get data, which might be less biased by manual observation. 14. Fig. 7 A \\nWe thank reviewer #1 for the insightful, critical and constructive comments. We performed new experiments to address these comments, and moderated our conclusions as suggested where necessary, while balancing the modifications keeping comments of reviewer #3 in mind who suggested to better highlight the merits of the study.\\nMajor Issues Comment 1. \"Throughout the report, the panels in the figures do not correlate with the references in the text. While the figure # is correct, the letter they relate to in the text is incorrect especially in all of the MERS-CoV figures.\"\\nWe apologize for these errors; we double-checked to make sure all the numbers and letters in the text correlate to the right figure and panel. \\nWe agree with the reviewer. In order to directly show that virus production (on request of reviewer 2 we are avoiding the word \"propagation\", because this refers to spreading from cell to cell which we do not show directly) is affected we determined the reduction of plaque forming units/ml in parallel to virus RNA copies per ml. Based on this comment and comments from the other reviewers, we performed new experiments and now display the fold difference (log10 scale) of the RNA analysis (genome equivalents, GE) and the plaque forming units, as well as the raw data of the genome equivalents in the new Figures 9B and S9A -C. Figure S9A shows the unprocessed data of the detected genome equivalents per ml, which are in good agreement with the GE data of the first submission. Clearly, the RNA analysis and the determination of the pfus revealed the same pattern of activity, indicating that both assays are valid to investigate the influence of autophagy inducers on MERS-CoV replication/growth. We chose to examine the role of autophagy on MERS-CoV growth in multi-cycle replication assays in order to identify meaningful effects that reflect physiological conditions. Only a few MERS-CoV particles are necessary to establish an infection in the respiratory tract. All assays were, therefore, performed with a low MOI. Importantly, we used two different time points (e.g. 24 and 48 hours post infection) to account for effects during the exponential growth of the virus (24 hours) and the plateau of virus production (48 hours). Comment 3. The control protein for Figure 2 is TRAF6 to show that there is no effect on BECN1 protein levels via an additional ubiquitination protein. However TRAF6 is not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. It should be shown as a comparison to vector alone.\\nWe performed the requested experiment and replaced panels E and F of Figure 2 . On the request of reviewer #3, these panels now also display conditions including the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Similarly to the cycloheximide assay (panels C and D), TRAF6 did not affect protein stability of Beclin1.\\nLegend of Figure 2E ,F: \"The conditions of C,D were also used in the pulse-chase assay, performed as in Fig. 1E ,F, to determine BECN1 stability.\" Figure 4D where 3-MA has no effect on protein levels. This is not discussed in the text.\"\\nResponse:\\n3-MA was used at a concentration of 10 mM, which is the concentration typically used for the inhibition of autophagy (for example Cell 2010; 140: 313-326). We are aware of the reports that 3-MA can have effects beyond blocking autophagy, and even promote autophagy under certain conditions. This is also stated in the third edition of the \"Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy\" (AUTOPHAGY 2016; 12: 1-222), page 54: \"For example, 3-MA is commonly used to inhibit starvation-or rapamycin-induced autophagy, but it has no effect on BECN1-independent forms of autophagy, and some data indicate that this compound can also have stimulatory effects on autophagy\". In our case, the goal was to investigate BECN1-dependent autophagy, for which 3-MA should work according to these guidelines. Moreover, we do see inhibition of induced autophagy, because the enhanced proteolysis of long-lived proteins (induced by si-RNA targeting Skp2 that enhances BECN1 protein levels, Fig We changed the manuscript by providing the concentration of 3-MA in the figure legends as well as in the methods section, by correcting the description of the turnover assay in the results section, and by providing more citations. We noted that there was a wrong wording in our description of the turn-over assay, which may have misled this reviewer, and we apologize for this. The section now reads ( Figure  3I is now Figure 4M ):\\n\"In order to verify that reduced SKP2 activity drives autophagy in our cellular set-up, we used siRNA and determined the degradation of long-lived proteins 48 . Targeting SKP2 increased proteolysis, but not in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3methyladenine (3-MA, Fig. 4M ). Furthermore, we observed decreased levels of p62 (Fig. S1G) , which typically goes along with enhanced autophagy48. All these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of SKP2 on autophagy regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving FKBP51, PHLPP and AKT1.\\nComment 5. \"For Figure 4 , there are several controls missing in the figure. First, there are no toxicity controls showing that the range of each inhibitor used is below significant cell toxicity levels. Secondly, the control in 4D using HBSS as an inducer of autophagy is not shown. Please show experimental evidence that in this experiment HBSS induces autophagy. Third, in 4E, BECN1 levels increase with all drugs; however LC3B increases with only 2 of them, and there doesn\\'t seem to be a change in P62. There should be some correlation between these results but there is no consistency.\"\\nResponse:\\nTo 5.1: Figure S2A displays the toxicity controls and shows that each inhibitor is used at a concentration below significant cell toxicity.\\nTo 5.2: We performed flux assays with HBSS and BafA1 which confirmed the induction of autophagic flux by HBSS. These data are now presented as Figure S2D : Figure 5E , for the WCE blot it is not clear how you can observe both SNAP29 and STX17 in the same blot where it does not show up in the IP blots. Shouldn\\'t they be in the same complex since they are crosslinked so they show as 1 band? The order of 5F and G should be reversed. And 5F is not clear. I assume it is a quantitation of 5G, however it does not match the data in 5G. The relationship between ATG14 monomeric and oligomeric forms and autophagy is not made clear. Are there published data showing oliogomeric ATG14 actively inhibits autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or simply that it fails to promote fusion? Also, if MERS is inhibiting oligomerization, I would expect there to be an increase in monomer, which is not seen. Does total ATG14 amount change? Please clarify.\"\\nResponse:\\nTo 6.1: We apologize for the errors in Figure numbering , which we corrected.\\nTo 6.2 Figure 5E : WCE in Figure 5E (now Fig. 6H (page 14) :\\n\"In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosomelysosome fusion 7 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 (Fig. S2H, I) .\"\\nComment 7. \"The MERS-CoV infections experiments in the supplemental figure S3 is also confusing. First, the cropped cells in S3E do not line up, please clean up the cropping. Secondly, there does not seem to be an increase yellow staining and a correlated decrease in red staining in the single cell shown in each panel. This example cell does not correlate with F. Third, the mutant viruses with either 4b or 5 deleted are great, however does the 4b deletion virus still contain the entire 4a coding region or was is 4a ORF effected when 4b was deleted? The oligos are in the methods section but no explanation in the text to the sites of the deletion. There are also no growth curves showing the 2 deletion viruses compared to WT virus. Do they grow equally well in the experiments or are they attenuated in their growth under control conditions? Fourth, the virus output that is examined in K is only looking at mRNA with no statistically significant different noted however it is stated in the text that the SKP2i inhibitor effects MERS growth. The K panel seems to be missing data. And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?\"\\nResponse:\\nTo 7.1 and 7.2: We improved the example images of Figure S3E (now figure 6D) 8A ). In the supplement, we also included the unprocessed data showing the GE/m (S5A). In Figure 9B ,C we establish that GE/ml and PFU/ml can both be used to obtain an estimate of the virus growth.\\nComment 8. \"In the model figure and in the discussion, there is no description of data presented to show the direct effect of SKP2 on ATG14 oligomerization. Since this is a key feature of the model, it would be important to show that SKP2 siRNA or inhibition by drugs effects the ATG14 oligo/monomer relationship.\"\\nResponse: Figure 8D ,E (former figure 6F) shows the effect of SKP2 inhibition on ATG14 oligomerisation in MERS-CoV infected cells. The inhibitor produced more ATG14 oligomers, but had no effect on the amount of ATG14 monomers. As mentioned in our response to major point 6, we find the absence of effect on ATG14 monomers in the presence of pronounced effects on ATG14 oligomers difficult to explain, but this has been observed by others in different settings as well. The idea is not that SKP2 causes ATG14 oligomerisation directly, but that this has recently been shown as crucial step in functional autophagy (Nature 2015 520: 563-566) and thus was included in our analyses.\\nWe mention this now first in the results to new Figure S2H , as also explained in our response to comment 6.2: \"In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosome-lysosome fusion 7 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 (Fig. S2H,I) \".\\nFurther, the description of panel D in the legend of Figure 9 (former Figure 7) now is: \"Summary scheme: SKP2 leads to K48-linked poly-ubiquitination and thus degradation of BECN1. The effect of SKP2 can be diminished in two ways, either by chemical inhibition or by FKBP51, which scaffolds protein interactions ultimately leading to SKP2 inactivation through inhibiting its phosphorylation. Both scenarios enhance autophagy, which involves ATG14 oligomerization (probably 7-8mers) as newly described essential step in functional autophagy 7 . MERS-CoV reduces autophagy through distinct viral proteins leading to blockade of autophagosomelysosome fusion and ATG14 oligomerization. Compounds inhibiting SKP2 reinstate autophagy and efficiently reduce viral production.\"\\nMinor comment 1. \" Figure 1B . The whole cell lysates shown in the 2nd and 3rd lane for BECN1 (3rd blot down) are different however they are the same in the IP blot for BECN1 (2nd blot down). Please correct or explain why there are differences.\"\\nWe replaced the blot with a more suitable example:\\n\"Gassen et al reported here a very complete study of a novel regulation of autophagy by SKP2, a E3 ubiquitin ligase. They nicely demonstrated that SKP2 targets BECN1, an autophagy protein which is involved in autophagosome formation and maturation in two different complexes. SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins. They identified and studied a pharmacological compound, SMIP004, which strongly inhibits SKP2. The results presented her are novel, technically sound and contribute to a better understanding of autophagy regulation.\\nA second part of the article is dedicated to a possible therapeutic application of their data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. MERS-CoV is a human betacoronavirus responsible of a severe viral respiratory disease, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A third of reported patients with MERS have died and no antiviral treatment is currently available. They first demonstrated that MERS CoV blocks autophagy, in particular the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, using several reliable autophagy monitoring experiments. They identified three nonstructural viral proteins which can recapitulate the block of the autophagic flux observed during viral infection. They constructed recombinant viruses deleted for these genes but unfortunately poorly characterized their phenotype.\\nFinally they tested the effect of this SKP2 inhibitor, SMIP004 at 10µM, on MERS-CoV infection and observed an important inhibition of its multiplication. Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data. In conclusion, this article reports totally new and important data on both autophagy regulation by SKP2 and on interaction between MERS-CoV and autophagy and a possible antiviral role of autophagy, which can be used as an innovative therapeutic approach.\"\\nWe thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. We believe to have addressed the major concerns of this reviewer by i) characterizing the phenotype of the MERS- The authors need therefore to modify this sentence.\"\\nWe modified and expanded the description as follows (üage 14, former Fig. S3F is now Fig. 6C ):\\n\"Infection with MERS-CoV further led to an increase of the total number of phagocytic vesicles (sum of AL + AP) per cell (Fig. 6C,D) . However, the number of successfully formed AL was reduced significantly, indicating that AP can form but not fuse with lysosomes when cells are infected. A fusion block was also evidenced by the significantly reduced ATG14 oligomerization, essential for AP-lysosome fusion 7 , in infected cells (Fig. 6E,F) and by the increase of the autophagy target P62 (Fig.  S3C ).\"\\n\"The results presented in Figure 5 clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV blocks autophagosome maturation rather that initial steps of autophagosome formation. The titer of Figure 5 is therefore not adapted to the results and should be replaced by \"blocks autophagic flux\".\"\\nWe agree and modified the title of \"\"In order to confirm the influence of p4b and p5 on virus replication, we performed loss of…for the step-wise construction of an ORF4b-and ORF5-deleted MERS-CoV\" \"The deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in 10-fold lower replication efficiency 48 hours p.i. (Fig. 6B )\"\\nThe characterization of the recombinant viruses presented in this study is clearly insufficient. No genome sequence analysis was reported. Growth kinetics of the different viruses showing viral titers (pfu/ml) at different times need to be added instead of measuring an inhibitory effect of the deletion (fig 6B) .\"\\nWe agree that \"inhibitory effect\" might have been a less precise wording for Figure  6B . Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity.\"\\nAs shown above, we reproduced the experiment independently and now include the PFU/ml and the GE/ml data in the manuscript (Fig. S4E,F) .\\n…\" Deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in reduced MERS-CoV growth. These results differ from previous observations, which may be related to different cell lines and cDNA clone construction strategies 72, 73 . In addition, we used a very low MOI and a type I IFN-deficient cell line (VeroB4), which allows to determine minor growth differences.\"… Comment Figure 6 panel C\\nThe authors concluded that mutant viruses do not control autophagy compared to parental virus. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.\\nWe now provide quantification of LC3BII/I along with the western blot ( Figure  S4C \\nComment Panel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells? If growth kinetics of mutant viruses are similar to that of parental virus, this would allow the authors to confirm the antiviral role of autophagy on MERS-CoV and to reveal a possible requirement of orf4b or orf5 to counteract it.\\nResponse:\\nthe other hand does not support the conclusion that p4b or p5 are responsible for this effect. Therefore, we moderated our conclusion to this point. The results are presented in the new figure S4E ,F which we copied above in response to another issue of the reviewer.\\n\"Deletion of p4b and p5 led to a decreased accumulation of P62 and LC3B-II/I, suggesting that both proteins contribute to the inhibition of the autophagic flux (Fig.  S4C,D) . The p4b-and p5-deleted viruses as well as the WT control virus grew to higher levels in ATG5 knockout Vero cells compared to WT cells (Fig. S4E,F) . However, the p4b and p5-deleted viruses showed overall an up to 10-fold decreased replication in both WT and ATG5 knockout cells compared to WT virus suggesting a p4b-and p5-dependent attenuation of virus replication that is independent of ATG5directed autophagy.\" Comment Figure 6 The titer of the legend does not reflect the results. No data in this figure demonstrates that SKP2 inhibition reduces viral replication.\\nWe agree and took care to make sure the titles better reflect the figures. With the new data, figures were rearranged, so figure 6 now largely is integrated into figure 8, but not entirely.\\n\"Regarding SKP2 inhibitor, effect on viral replication is impressive, but same remark than above, growth kinetics and determination of viral titers are necessary.\"\\nIn the revised manuscript we included a modified version showing the fold change difference between DMSO vs Skp2i-treated cells (now figure 8A ). In the supplement (Fig. S5A) , we also include the unprocessed data showing the GE/ml. As outlined above ( Figure S4E ,F) and below ( Figures 9B, S9A-C) , we showed for several cases that GE/ml can be used as a surrogate for PFU/ml.\\nNew figure 8A and S5A:\\nComment Page 15, continued:\\n\"Moreover, to prove that the compound is acting via autophagy, effect of SMIP004 should be tested in autophagy deficient cells. This kind of approach was used for antibacterial activity of tat-beclin1 for example, in reference 46, Shoji-Kawata et al Nature 2013. \"\\nWe agree that testing the effect of SMIP004 in autophagy-deficient cells would add useful information. We actually considered performing the mentioned experiment; however, due to reconstruction work of the BSL3 laboratory during the revision, we were not able to perform this experiment in a timely manner. We reasoned that other experiments requested by the reviewers (e.g. providing pfus) needed to be given higher priority in using the very limited BSL3 laboratory availability. all these compounds might have additional effects and mention this in the discussion, where we adapted our conclusions (page 25): \"From the present results, therapeutic induction of autophagy by inhibition of SKP2 emerges as a novel approach. We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.\" Furthermore, we changed the title of the manuscript to: \"SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection\".\\n\"ABT-737 and Tat-Beclin both inhibit MERS-CoV replication and they \"leave the levels of BECN1 unchanged\". Therefore, the authors cannot conclude just after that \"increasing BECN1 is the relevant mechanism\". We can make the same remark on page 18, on the mechanism of SKP2 inhibitor by enhancing BECN1 levels. Effects of overexpression of BECN1 on CoV replication should be tested. A siRNA against BECN1 will confirm the involvment of BECN1 and autophagy in CoV replication.\"\\nWe agree that the conclusion was not stringent the way it was presented. All we can state is that another and independent mechanism that enhances BECN1\\'s activity in autophagy elicits the same antiviral effect on MERS. This suggests that of the activities potentially elicited by enhancing BECN1 protein levels it is autophagy that is relevant, but it does not prove it. As mentioned above, cotransfection experiments (including overexpression of Beclin1) in combination with viral infection were not successful, unfortunately, in particular using any kind of siRNA (which also would risk to generate off-target effects). We refined the description in the results section (page 20):\\n\"Our data strongly suggest that of the potential mechanisms of SKP2i, it is the increase of BECN1-directed autophagy that reduces MERS-CoV multiplication. If this is correct, other ways of enhancing BECN1\\'s effect on autophagy should elicit similar effects. Therefore, we used two recently introduced tools to enhance BECN1 function in autophagy: the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and a BECN1-derived peptide 58,59 . These compounds, in contrast to SKP2i, do not change the levels of BECN1, but increase autophagy by redirecting BECN1 function towards the autophagy pathway, which we confirmed in VeroB4 cells (Fig. S7B-D,G) . Enhanced autophagy was indicated by the increase of LC3B-II/I (Fig. S7E,G) and the reduction of P62 (Fig. S7F-G) . This was paralleled by inhibition of MERS-CoV replication by up to 60-fold in the case of the BECN1-peptide (TAT-B) (Fig. S7H) and 10-fold in the case of ABT-737 at 48 h p.i. (Fig. S7I) . These results are in accordance with the notion that increasing BECN1 acts through enhancing autophagy as the relevant mechanism for the antiviral effects of SKP2 in vitro.\"\\nThe authors need to report that several of their tested drugs have well-described activity on autophagy, such as niclosamide, valinomycin, salinomycin and gossypol. They only confirmed previous studies. Moreover, these compounds are not only SKP2 inhibitors and specific autophagy inhibitors but have other activities since for example Niclosamide increases mitochondrial fission and valinomycin is a potassium ionophore. Once again, viral replication should be explored using plaque assay and growth kinetics.\\nWe agree that autophagy induction of these compounds has been shown before. This actually is the reason why the compounds were chosen, as mentioned in the text. The intention was to begin to explore, whether there might be readily available drugs that tap into the pathway presented in the manuscript. We modified the results section, because it could have been misunderstood (page 22):\\n\"These results encouraged us to test other potential inhibitors of SKP2. Autophagyinducing, FDA-approved drugs and drugs from clinical trials were of particular interest as these could become more readily available for treatment in humans. Of note, valinomycin (VAL), which has been shown to target SARS-CoV in vitro 50,61 , is also known to act as an SKP2 inhibitor 49 .\" Figures 9B, S9A -C). Raw data (absolute quantification of viral RNA as \"genome equivalents, GE\" and infectious particles as \"plaque forming units, PFU\", all presented now in the new Figures S9A,C) of this experiment showed that the difference between GE and PFU is 1000-fold irrespective of the drug used. In other words, whether we used real-time RT-PCR or the pfu assay did not matter, because we obtained the same pattern among all drugs. Therefore, the determination of EC50 values of VAL, NIC and SKP2i was performed only by real-time RT-PCR. Figure 7 panels B and C \"The unusable way to determine the antiviral activity does not valorize the impressive results. Even if all these drugs inhibit SKP2, they have other activities. Therefore, the title needs to be modified unless impact of SKP2 is tested by gene silencing.\"\\nFollowing the reviewer´s suggestion, we changed the title of Figure 9 (~previous  figure 7) to \"Test of potential SKP2 inhibitors for their effects on autophagy and viral replication\", because silencing of SKP2 by siRNA did not work and appears to be toxic for the cells, unfortunately. We copied the new figures 9B and S9A-C (the experiments of the previous figure 7B have been repeated and expanded to include pfus) in our response to the comment before.\\nIn addition, we changed the title of the manuscript to: \"SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection\".\\nComment Discussion page 21 line 5 \"Same remark than above, unless they are testing SKP2 knock down, the authors cannot conclude on impact of SKP2 inhibition on viral multiplication.\\nThe authors should report in the discussion that autophagy has no antiviral effect on MHV, another betacoronavirus.\"\\nWe agree that the conclusion only goes as far as the specificity of the compounds. As detailed above, we modified the title and text accordingly. MHV is now mentioned in the introduction (copied in response to an earlier point above).\\nIn conclusion regarding the antiviral activities the authors clearly identified components able to block MERS-CoV replication but the mechanism by SKP2 inhibition is not so far demonstrated.\\nAs detailed in the response to the specific points above, we modified the text to moderate this specific claim.\\nMinor remarks: Comment Figure 1 \"\"(C-F) FKP51…. Transfected with vector control… or FKP51\" add (Co) after control\"\\nWe modified the figure panels as requested. Figure 3 panel I \"Information regarding $$ is missing in the legend. Unfortunate that only LLP degradation was tested with siRNA against SKP2 and no other readout for autophagy such as LC3 of p62.\"\\nWe added the missing information to the figure legend (former panel I of figure 3 is  now panel M of figure 4) . Additional effects observed with the siRNA were the decrease of Beclin1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2I) , the increase in Beclin1 levels and stability (Figs. 2G, J-M, S1C) , the increase in LC3BII/I (Figs. 2G, S1C ) the increase of ATG14 oligomerisation (Fig. S2H,I) , the restoration of autophagic flux in MERS-CoV infected cells (Fig. S7J) , and the decrease of p62 (new Fig. S1G) . \\nWe apologize for this error, which must have been confusing. The sentence is now corrected.\\n\"\"we aimed to test if blocking the SKP2 dependent autophagy inhibition influences CoV replication\". To improve the understanding of this sentence, it is better to say \"if stimulation of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitor influences MERS-CoV replication. Add MERS instead of just CoV because, it was tested only for this coronavirus.\"\\nWe agree with the reviewer and thank for this kind suggestion. This section, marking the transition to the viral investigations, is now completely revised, and this specific sentence disappeared. The transition now reads: \"Results up to this point suggested that activity of BECN1 and thereby autophagy is limited by SKP2, which in turn is activated by AKT1 ( 46 and Fig. 3/4) . Since MERS-CoV has been shown to enhance phosphorylation of AKT1 25 , it might reduce autophagy.\"\\nComment Page 13-15\\n\"Several mistakes in the labelling of panels for figure S3\\nPage 13 S3DE is S3EF; S3F is in fact S3G, S3G is S3H page 15 S3H is S3I I is J and J is K Figure S3K what is the condition \"Co\"? same question for Figure Comment pages 2 4 15 17 20 22 \"The word \"propagation\" is used several times in the text, but corresponds in fact to viral cell-to-cell spread and is not tested here.

As we transferred cell-free virus-containing supernatants to non-infected cells to determine the amount of infectious units, we think that now it would be appropriate to use word virus propagation. Nevertheless, we modified our wording.\\nFinal comment \"Finally the title does not totally reflect data presented in the article, because impact of SKP2 on viral replication has been explored only using compounds which have other activities than just inhibiting SKP2.\"\\nWe changed the title to \"SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection\".\\nAutophagy is a cellular homeostatic pathway that can mediate degradation of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins and other cargo like viral components. Being a destructive process, autophagy has to be tightly controlled. Indeed, intricate signalling pathways regulate both induction and flux rates of autophagy. Recent reports have highlighted the impact of autophagy on many cellular processes and its role as an anti-viral mechanism.\\nGassen et al had previously identified FKBP51 as a beclin-binding protein, which mediates induction of autophagy (Gassen et al, 2014&2015) . Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-byside (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly.\\nA few specific issues need to be addressed as well:\\nMajor:\\n\"Treatment with drugs can have multiple effects on viral replication. Therefore, even though all used drugs presumably target a similar pathway, it has to be made sure that autophagy is responsible for viral attenuation. The authors should conduct experiments in which autophagy is induced (e.g. by mentioned drugs), but the effects of this induction are blocked. For example, can the growth attenuation be rescued if autophagic turnover is blocked by chloroquine, or LC3B conjugation inhibited by ATG5 KO/KD? Furthermore, the chosen drugs used to inhibit SKP2 (even though it is backed up by literature) need direct evidence that SKP2-dependent beclin-1 ubiquitination is reduced.\"\\nWe tried to use chloroquine, but this turned out to be toxic for the cells. Furthermore, ATG5 KD (or any other transfection experiment, in particular siRNA transfection) was not successful in combination with viral infection. Thus, we constructed ATG5 KO in VeroB4 cells and found that MERS-CoV replicates better in these cells. As mentioned in our response to reviewer 2, we agree that testing the effect of SMIP004 in autophagy-deficient cells would be useful. We actually considered performing the mentioned experiment; however, due to reconstruction work of the BSL3 laboratory during the revision, we were not able to perform this experiment in a timely manner. We reasoned that other experiments requested by the reviewers (e.g. providing pfus) needed to be given higher priority in using the very limited BSL3 laboratory availability. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that a) SMIP004 \\nreplication. We agree though, that all these compounds might have additional effects and mention this in the discussion, where we adapted our conclusions (page 25): \"From the present results, therapeutic induction of autophagy by inhibition of SKP2 emerges as a novel approach. We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.\"\\nIn line with these considerations, we changed the title of the manuscript to \"SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection\". This title leaves open which exact molecular pathway might be responsible for the effect of these inhibitors.\\n\"The interesting data on MERS-CoV prompts the question, how do other viruses, which are known to be sensitive towards autophagy, react towards inhibition of SKP2. Experiments exploring the effect of the drugs on e.g. Sindbis Virus or HIV-1 replication should clarify that issue and would complement the MERS-CoV data and make it less focused on treating a single virus with a system potentially applicable for other viral pathogens.\" Sindbis virus also turned out to be somewhat sensitive towards SKP2 inhibition, even though much less pronounced than MERS-CoV. This may be explained by a differential interaction of both viruses with the autophagic flux. The Sindbis data are now included in the manuscript as Figure \\nWe observed that SKP2 null MEFs grow extremely slow. Therefore, we used siRNA against SKP2 as before (the efficiency is documented in Figs 2G/S1C). We performed all the requested experiments and found that siRNA targeting SKP2 increased the stability of Beclin1 and ectopic overexpression of SKP2 had no effect in the presence of MG132, proving a proteasomal-dependent effect. In addition, to more thoroughly address this question we also assessed ubiquitination of Beclin1 in combination with siRNA against SKP2. These data are now included in Figure Legend to Figure 2C ,D: SKP2 affects BECN1 stability. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing SKP2 or TRAF6 and exposed to MG132 (10 µM, 2 h) where indicated and to cycloheximide (CHX, 30 µg/mL) after 72 h for the durations indicated to monitor the decay of BECN1.\\nLegend to Figure 2E ,F: The conditions of C,D were also used in the pulse-chase assay, performed as in Fig. 1E ,F, to determine BECN1 stability.\\nLegend to Figure 2J -M: The stability assays of the panels C-F were performed to determine the effect of SKP2-targeting siRNA on BECN1 stability. All graphs (showing the means ± SEM) and all western blots are representative of three independent experiments. Legend to Figure 2I : Knock-down of SKP2 by siRNA decreases BECN1 ubiquitination (assay as in Fig. 1B) . Representative blots are shown. \" Fig. 3 : A few additional details have to be clarified: Is Beclin-1 K402R resistant towards degradation induced by either PHLPPi treatment or SKP2 overexpression? Since AKT1 is involved in the cascade, does pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 lead to stabilization of beclin-1?\"\\nWe compared the stability of Beclin1 WT and the K402R mutant in the cycloheximide assay, including the PHLPP inhibitor. We found that the K402R exhibited greater stability in comparison to WT Beclin1, and further resisted degradation induced by PHLPPi. We also tested the effect of two different Akt1 inhibitors on Beclin1 stability. Both inhibitors increased the stability of Beclin1. These data are now presented as figure 4G -J:\\nLegend to Figure 4G -J: The cycloheximide protein stability assay was performed (as in Fig. 1C,D) to evaluate the effect of PHLPPi on K402-BECN1 in comparison to wt BECN1 (G,H) and to test the effects of AKT1 inhibitors (AktiX and MK2206) on wt BECN1 (I,J).\\nThe abstract needs rephrasing to emphasise the achievements of this paper in a more cohesive and appealing way. The current abstract undersells the story.\\nWe thank the reviewer for the kind comment. We tried to emphasize the achievements while avoiding overstatements. Combined with the other reviewers\\' comments, and in line with this comment, we tried to make sure that the core of our findings comes across, which is a novel pathway for the induction of autophagy. The potential usefulness of compounds addressing this pathway in fighting MERS-CoV infection serves more as an example of possible applications. Whether or not MERS-CoV has evolved mechanisms to tone down autophagy probably is less relevant in this context, but it is a question that naturally comes up and this is why we explored this also. The abstract now focusses more on the novel pathway leading to autophagy induction: \"Beclin1 (BECN1) is a key regulator of autophagy. We here identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. FK506 binding protein 51 associates with and stabilizes BECN1 by scaffolding the assembly of a hetero-complex involving PHLPP, AKT1, SKP2 and BECN1 that limits phosphorylation and thus activity of SKP2. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging and lethal human respiratory virus for which no specific treatment is available. We found that MERS-CoV multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhanced autophagy but also reduced the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a novel target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.\"\\nMinor comment 2:\\nThe title of the paper could be shortened to sound less convoluted.\\nWe changed the title to: \"SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection\". We tried to simplify the title by constructing it along the two parts (novel mechanism of autophagy regulation and potential application to treatment). As we describe a novel mechanism regarding the SKP2-dependent control of autophagy and additionally show that the induction of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitors has a pronounced effect on MERS-CoV infection we would like to keep both subjects in the title.\\nWriting of the results section (first part) might need improvement to make it more accessible. Furthermore, mechanistic details could be presented more cohesively to focus on the achievements of the paper.\\nThank you for the kind comment. We rewrote the results section along the lines laid out in the response to minor comment 2.\\nMinor comment 4:\\n\"Please add size markers to all the western blots.\"\\nWe added size markers to all western blots of figure 1. In our opinion, this makes the figure look very busy, so we suggest to refrain from this in the other figures.\\nMinor comment 5: \" Fig. 1 B: Stabilization of beclin-1 levels by MG132 has to be compared to NH4Cl treatment, to rule out turnover by autophagy.\"\\nWe included NH 4 Response:\\nWe include data on p62 as example of a protein that is degraded by autophagy. These data are now included in Figure S1G .\\nNew Fig. S1G :\\nLegend to Figure S1G : \\nThe quantification is shown in figure S2E -G (referring to Fig. 5E, former figure 4E ).\\nLegend to figure S2E-G: VeroB4 cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors (C1 (3.3 µM), SMIP004 (10 µM), SMER3 (5 µM)) and the indicated protein levels were determined (mean + SEM of three independent experiments; quantification to the western blots in Fig. 5E ).\\nMinor comment 10:\\n\" Fig. 5D and E: Both figure panels could be moved to the supplements, as the effect observed is only marginal and other data presented is stronger.\"\\nResponse: Figure 5D is now figure S3D . We agree the effect shown in former figure 5E is quite small. It is hard to predict though, to what degree SNARE protein associations have to change to produce a significant effect on vesicle fusion; furthermore, but less important, former panel E of figure 5 could nicely be accommodated into the new figure 6 . Thus, we kept 5E in the main figures (now figure 6H ).\\nMinor comment 11:\\n\" Fig. 6A : While interesting, the sketch could be moved to the supplements.\"\\nWe completely agree and moved the panel to the supplement ( Figure S4A ).\\n\" Fig. 6G : Could be moved to the supplements\"\\nSome reasoning as above for Fig. 5E. Former figure 6G is now figure 8F.\\nMinor comment 13:\\n\" Fig. 6E : While manual counting is certainly being used a lot, these assays could be alternatively quantified using flow cytometry to get data, which might be less biased by manual observation.\"\\nWe agree that FACS would be a useful method for this type of assay. We would like to point out that counting was performed by a scientist blind to the conditions. This is now mentioned in the methods description. The effect size is considerable, so it appeared to us that the quantification method chosen is useful. In addition, there is no FACS in the BSL3 laboratory we are using. We were not allowed to export samples from the BSL3 to perform FACS analysis in an external core facility.\\nMinor comment 14:\\n\" Fig. 7 A,B: Is there a correlation between autophagy induction and MERS-CoV inhibition?\"\\nIn general, the compounds that are more effective in inducing autophagy are also more effective in MERS-CoV inhibition (now Figure 9A \\nGeneral comment: \"The extensive revisions in this manuscript add to the already large datasets that was included in the original version. The amount of data in this new version clearly separates between 2 stories. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents an entirely separate story, on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV including live virus and how individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. It is unclear why these 2 stories are combined into this large of a paper and it diminishes the goal of making a clear and organized manuscript. The first story on SKP2 and Beclin1 are clear and direct while the second story on MERS-CoV and how it effects and is affected by autophagic machinery is still unfinished with data that is discordant with the text descriptions of it.\"\\nWe agree that the manuscript might be lengthy and that separating it into two manuscripts might be an option, in principle. In conclusion, we think that the combination of data regarding the MERS-CoVdependent modulation of autophagy and the potential treatability of this virus by addressing the novel SKP2-autophagy pathway is highly beneficial for the manuscript.\\nSpecific comment 1:\\n\"The addition of the raw fold changes and PFU/ml are helpful in determining the effects of autophagy on MERS-CoV replication however the RNA and PFU levels do not correlate with each other. In the added figures of Figure 9B and the supplementary figures associated with it, the fold changes and raw PFU and genome numbers do not correlate with increases and decreases going in opposite directions. There is also no quantitation of significance in these figures making it difficult to interpret as described in the text.\"\\nThe comment concerns figures 9B and S9A, which display the fold difference (9B) and the raw data (S9A) of the genome equivalents, as well as figures S9B and S9C, which display the fold difference (S9B) and the raw data (S9C) of the pfu measurements. We realized that there was a mistake in the column coloring for DMSO in Figure 9B which may have caused confusion. We apologize for this and corrected the colors. The DMSO black column (left) and gray column (right) were switched. In addition, we would like to emphasize that one has to compare all gray columns (24 hours post infection) and all black columns (48 hours post infection) separately. In Figure 9B the DMSO control was set to 1 for both time points and cannot directly be related to Figure S9A which shows the raw data in log scale. As growth differences are difficult to identify on a log scale we decided to show fold-change in relation to the DMSO control in Figure 9B . Since the presentation of the fold differences in Figures 9B and S9B are mathematical derivatives of the raw data displayed in Figures S9A and S9C The reviewer is completely right by saying that a direct comparison between GE/ml ( Figure S9A ) and PFU/ml (Figures S9C) shows some minor discrepancies for some of the compounds. This may be explained by interference of the respective compounds with the production of infectious viral particles which may subsequently influence the GE/ml to PFU/ml ratio. Mechanistic details of these minor discrepancies were not addressed and would be beyond the scope of this paper.\\nOverall, however, as explained in our response to the first round of comments, the GE/ml and PFU/ml pattern is highly similar. We are now providing quantification of significance. In addition, we submit all raw data to these figures. The text claims significant differences however that is not evident in the calculations of the figures.\"\\nWe are now providing quantification of significance. In addition, we submit all raw data to these figures in a data source file that covers all figures.\\nSpecific comment 3: \"The newly added TRAF6 control data requested in Figure 2 does not correlate with the graph presented. An initial concern for this figure is that ectopic TRAF6 was not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. The authors have now added in the data showing TRAF6 ectopically expressed in this experiment. The text states, as well as the graph of the western blots, that TRAF6 ectopically expressed in the cells does not effect Beclin 1 levels. However the western blots associated with Figure 2E clearly show a stabilizing effect on Beclin1 protein levels, which does not correlate with the graph shown in Figure 2F . There does not seem to be a way to connect the western blot data with that graphed in Figure 2F . The data suggests that the ectopic expression of SKP2 shows beclin1 degradation at the same level as expression of TRAF6. This is not what is shown in the western blots. It is unclear how the graph could be made from the data provided in the figure.\"\\nResponse: It appears to us that the reviewer\\'s impression derives from a combination of our poor selection of the blot example and maybe screen display. We are now submitting less exposed blots to this figure, along with the quantification data of the individual blots in the data source file.\\nSpecific comment 4: \"The addition of Figure S2D in response to the question of whether the use of HBSS and BafA1 are inducing autophagic flux as expected is warranted. However again the quantification of the western blot and the images of the western blot are not the same. The graph suggests that the LC3II/I ratio is the same for HBSS and BafA1 treatment however the western blot does not show that same correlation. It is clear in the western blot provided that the 2 sets of data are not equal. While the western blot does show reduction of LC3II in HBSS treatment suggesting autophagic flux, the data do not correlate between the graph and the blot shown.\"\\nWe agree that the western blot did not fully reflect the average given in the graph, partly due to, as we suspect, the higher abundance of LC3I in comparison to LC3II which makes it difficult to select blots that visualize differences in the two LC3 species equally well for the eye. As before, we are now submitting less exposed blots (new experiment) along with the raw data of the quantification. II to actin (or any other protein) would not change the numbers. While this is mentioned in the supplementary methods, we realized that we mentioned the Actin antibody, but failed to state that it was used for normalization. We are grateful for the hint and added a respective sentence in the supplement (page 23, last sentence).\\nMinor point 4: \"Regardless of the availability of BSL3 space (which I agree can be a limiting factor), I still think that experiments in ATG5 KO cells need to be done, even though all hints and all evidence points towards autophagy and the MERS CoV phenotype being connected. However, this might be beyond the scope of this paper.\"\\nWe agree on the usefulness of this experiment. We further adjusted our wording and mention this experiment for future work, also considering the comments of reviewer 1(discussion, page 29).', \"Data are limited about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection risk among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) and whether personal protective equipment (PPE) mitigates this risk.\\nWe performed a prospective cohort study among 2,135,190 individuals using the COVID Symptom Tracker smartphone application to collect information among frontline HCWs and the general community since March 24, 2020 (United Kingdom) and March 29, 2020 (United States). We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive Covid-19 test through April 23, 2020.\\nAmong 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive Covid-19 test over 34,435,273 person-days.

(which was not certified by peer review)\\nSince its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health threat. 1 As of April 2020, over 2.8 million cases of Covid-19 have been documented worldwide with nearly 200,000 deaths. 2,3 With ongoing community transmission from asymptomatic individuals across numerous international foci, 4-8 the burden of this disease is expected to continue rising over the coming weeks. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Consequently, there will be an ongoing need for frontline healthcare workers (HCW) in patient-facing roles. Because this work requires close personal exposure to patients with the virus, frontline HCWs are at high risk of infection, which may contribute to further spread. 13,14 Initial regional estimates suggest frontline HCWs may account for 10-20% of all diagnoses, 15-17 which may be an underestimate when compared to other developed and similarly affected nations such as Italy. 18 Based on experience with other viruses spread by respiratory droplets, the consistent use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical to reducing nosocomial transmission. 19, 20 Recent guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) advocate for the use of medical-grade masks and respirators at all times to deliver clinical care. 21 However, global shortages of masks, face shields, and gowns-exacerbated by surging demand and supply chain disruptions-have been documented, leading to efforts to conserve PPE through extended use or reuse and the development of sterilization protocols. [22] [23] [24] Although addressing the needs of frontline HCWs to effectively respond to the Covid-19 pandemic is a high priority, 17 there is a lack of prospective data to inform such efforts. Thus, we conducted a prospective, population-based study using a novel mobile-based application to examine the risk of testing positive for Covid-19 and/or developing symptoms associated with infection among 2,135,190 individuals in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United States (U.S.) between March 24 and April 23, 2020.\\n.

Participants are encouraged to use the application daily, even when asymptomatic, to allow for the longitudinal, prospective collection of symptoms and Covid-19 testing results.\\nThe application was launched in the U.K. on March 24, 2020 and available in the U.S. beginning on March 29, 2020. 25 Participants were recruited through social media outreach, as well as invitations from the investigators of long-running prospective cohort studies to study volunteers (Table S1 ). At enrollment, participants provided informed consent to the use of aggregated information for research purposes and agreed to applicable privacy policies and terms of use. This study was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee (Protocol 2020P000909) and King's College London Ethics Committee (REMAS ID 18210, LRS-19/20-18210). This protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04331509).\\nThe information collected through the app has been provided in detail. 25 Briefly, upon first use, participants were asked to provide baseline demographic factors and answered separate questions about a series of suspected risk factors for Covid-19 (Table S2) . On first use and upon daily reminders, participants were asked if they felt physically normal, and if not, their symptoms, including the presence of fever, fatigue, and loss of smell/taste (Table S3) . Participants were also asked if they had been tested for Covid-19 (yes/no), and if yes, the results (none, negative, pending, or positive).\\n.

(which was not certified by peer review)\\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 5, 2020. . At enrollment, individuals were asked if they worked in health care and if yes, whether they had direct patient contact. For our primary analysis, we defined frontline HCWs as participants who reported direct patient care.\\nAmong these individuals, we queried whether they had cared for suspected or documented Covid-19-infected patients and the frequency with which they used PPE (always, sometimes, never). We asked if they had enough PPE when needed, if they had to reuse PPE, or if they did not have enough because of shortages. We classified availability of PPE as adequate if they never required PPE or if they reported always having the PPE they needed (including reused PPE). We classified PPE availability as inadequate if they reported they did not have enough PPE or if it was not available. We also asked HCWs to report the site of their patient care.\\nFollow-up time started at the time participants first reported on the app and accrued until the report of a positive Covid-19 test or the time of last data entry, whichever occurred first. We employed Cox proportional hazards modeling stratified by age, date, and country to estimate age-and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). CI widths were not adjusted for multiplicity. A test of correlation between Schoenfeld residuals and survival time demonstrated no violation of the proportional hazards assumption. Covariates were selected a priori based on putative risk factors and included sex, history of diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, current smoking status (each yes/no), and body mass index (17-19.9, 20-24.9, 25-29.9 , and ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ). Missing categorical data was denoted with a missing indicator, while imputation methods for missing numerical data replaced no more than 5% with the median.\\nBecause the primary outcome (report of a positive Covid-19 test) was dependent on receiving a test, we performed several secondary analyses to ensure the robustness of our findings. First, we leveraged a symptom-based classifier developed by our group that is predictive of positive Covid testing. 26 Briefly, using logistic regression and symptoms preceding confirmatory testing, we found that loss of smell/taste, fatigue, persistent cough, and loss of appetite may predict Covid-19 positivity with high specificity (Suppl. Methods).\\nSecond, to account for country-specific predictors of obtaining testing, we performed separate inverse probability weighting (IPW) in the U.S. and the U.K. as a function of frontline HCW status and other factors, .

Methods). In analyses limited to frontline HCWs, we examined PPE availability and contact with suspected or documented Covid-19 patients, as well as the primary site of clinical practice. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R 3.6.1 (Vienna, Austria).\\nBetween March 24 and April 23, 2020, we enrolled 2,810,103 users (2,790,150 in the U.K. and 195,140 in the U.S.), defined as consenting participants who provided baseline information about either feeling normal or having symptoms (Fig. S1 ). Among users, 134,885 (4.8%) reported being a frontline HCW. We found a reported prevalence of 2,747 Covid-19-positive cases per 100,000 frontline HCWs compared to 242 per 100,000 in the general community (Fig. 1A) . Higher infection rates were reported in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana in the U.S. and in the areas around London and the Midlands in the U.K. (Fig. 1B) .\\nAfter excluding 670,298 participants who had follow-up time of less than 24 hours and 4,615 who reported a baseline positive Covid-19 test, we included 2,135,190 participants in our prospective inception cohort, among whom 99,795 persons identified as frontline HCWs (Fig. S1) . In this cohort, we recorded 24.4 million entries or 11.4 logs per participant with a median follow-up of 18.9 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1 to 26.1). The median age was 44 years (IQR 32 to 57). Compared to the general community, frontline HCWs were more frequently female, had a slightly higher prevalence of BMI ≥ 30, were slightly more likely to smoke, and use several common medications ( Table 1 & Table S3 ). At baseline, 20.2% of frontline HCWs reported at least one symptom associated with Covid-19 infection compared to 14.4% of the general population with fatigue, loss of smell/taste, and hoarse voice being particularly more frequent (Table S4) .\\n.

Among frontline HCWs, inadequate PPE availability was associated with a subsequent 23% increased risk of Covid-19. Although\\nHCWs caring for Covid-19 patients who reported inadequate PPE availability had the highest risk, an increased susceptibility to infection was evident even with adequate PPE. Frontline HCWs who worked in inpatient settings and nursing homes had the greatest risk.\\nOur findings complement early data showing that nearly 20% of the currently documented cases of Covid-19 are among HCWs. Our results provide a more precise assessment of the magnitude of increased risk among HCWs compared to their surrounding communities in the initial phases of this pandemic in both the U.K. and U.S. We also offer supportive evidence that sufficient availability of PPE, including reused PPE, reduces the risk of Covid-19 infection. However, even with reportedly adequate PPE availability, HCWs who cared for patients with documented Covid-19 remained at elevated risk, highlighting the importance of ensuring not only .

PPE availability, but also appropriate usage. In addition, the apparent lack of complete protection against acquiring Covid-19 infection through adequate supplies of PPE suggests that additional risk mitigation strategies require further investigation.\\nOur results are supported by historical data during similar infectious disease outbreaks. During the Ebola crisis, a disease with a comparable reproduction number (e.g. the R 0 measure of how many new cases can be generated from one infected individual), HCWs comprised 3.9% of all cases, an incidence 21-to-32-times greater than the general public. 27,28 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS) epidemic, HCWs comprised 20-40% of all cases, 29-32 and inadequate PPE availability was associated with an increased risk of illness among HCWs. 32 The experience with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 reaffirmed the importance of PPE 33, 34 and also showed much higher infection rates among HCWs working in dedicated infection containment units. 35 The strengths of this study include the use of a mobile application to rapidly collect prospective data from a large multinational cohort, which offers immediately actionable risk estimates to inform the public health response to an ongoing pandemic. 36 By recruiting participants through existing cohort studies (https://www.monganinstitute.org/cope-consortium), these results also provide proof-of-concept of the feasibility of leveraging existing infrastructure and engaged participants to address a key knowledge gap.\\nSecond, we collected information from participants initially free of a positive Covid-19 test, which offered an opportunity to prospectively assess risk factors for incident symptomatic infection with minimal recall bias.\\nThird, our study design documented initial onset of symptoms, which minimizes biases related to capturing only more severe cases through hospitalization records or death reports. Finally, we collected information on a wide range of known or suspected risk factors for Covid-19 infection which are generally not available in existing registries or population-scale surveillance efforts.\\nWe acknowledge several limitations. First, full details of some exposures were limited to ensure our survey instrument was brief, particularly for time-limited HCWs. For example, we did not ask about specific .

Second, our findings are based on self-report. Given the quickened pace of the pandemic, self-reported information was more feasible to collect. In future studies, self-reports with linkage to other sources (e.g. electronic health records) may be possible. Third, our cohort is not a random sampling of the population. Although this limitation is inherent to any study requiring voluntary provision of health information, we acknowledge that data collection through smartphone adoption has comparatively lower penetrance among certain socioeconomic groups, as well as older adults, despite being used by 81% of the U.S. adult population. 37 In future studies, we plan more targeted outreach of populations under-represented in the current cohort, as well as additional data collection instruments (e.g. web or phone surveys) that may be more accessible to certain groups. Finally, our primary outcome is based on report of a positive Covid-19 test. During the time frame of this study, this would generally reflect nasal or throat swabs, which are reasonably specific, but only modestly sensitive. 38 However, any testing misclassification should be non-differential by occupation. Our results may also reflect differences in access to testing among HCWs compared to the general community, as well as true differences in infection rates. In our secondary analyses, we also found that HCWs were at higher risk of a positive test even after adjusting for greater probability of receiving a test. Furthermore, HCWs were at higher risk of developing symptoms that predicted Covid-19, which does not reflect access to testing. Ideally, we would assess the risk of Covid-19 infection within a population which has undergone uniform screening. However, the current shortage of PCR-based testing kits does not make such an approach feasible. Future studies using serologic testing to ascertain Covid-19 infection will require additional assessment of test performance and the ability to distinguish recent or active infection from past exposure.\\nIn conclusion, within a large population-based sample of 2,135,190 individuals in the U.S. and U.K., we demonstrate a significantly increased risk of Covid-19 infection among frontline HCWs compared to the general community. This risk is greatest among individuals in direct contact with Covid-19 patients who report inadequate PPE availability, supporting the importance of providing adequate supplies. However, because infection risk remained elevated even with adequate PPE, our results suggest the need to ensure the proper use of PPE as well as adherence to other infection control measures.\\n.

SARS-CoV-2 causes a broad range of respiratory symptoms, ranging from subclinical disease to viral pneumonia. 1 Despite the recent availability of vaccines, approximately 500 000 individuals are still infected daily with SARS-CoV-2. It is increasingly apparent that like other severe respiratory virus infections, SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of extra-respiratory complications. 1, 2 Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism and other de novo cardiovascular complications. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There is also now a growing body of evidence of increased cardiovascular disease in convalescent COVID-19 patients. 8 Here, we review the current evidence of the acute and long-term cardiovascular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanisms by which it may cause cardiovascular disease.\\nThe primary cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the membrane-bound aminopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). In addition to binding to ACE-2, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 must be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary. 9 This cleavage can be effected by host cell surface proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L, which then primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for entry. 10 Additional cleavage by furin produces a sequence motif that binds to cell surface neuropilin-1, which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. 11 In vivo SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets epithelial cells within the respiratory tract, including type 2 pneumocytes in the lower respiratory tract. Whilst initial studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect endothelial cells, 12 this has recently been called into question. 13 Central to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the induction of a dysregulated pro-inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm. It is thought that this cytokine storm, and associated immunopathology, plays a significant role in both primary viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that is characteristic of severe COVID-19. 14 Cardiovascular disease in acute COVID-19\\nThe prevalence of myocardial injury and cardiovascular disease in the acute phase of COVID-19 varies dramatically between studies. This likely reflects the differing cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as hospital and laboratory facilities available across different countries.\\nMyocardial injury is defined as electrocardiogram abnormalities or an increase in cardiac enzyme and biomarker serum levels, such as troponin (cTnT), induced by ischaemia or non-ischaemic causes. 15 Myocardial injury, as defined by elevated cTnT, is found in 19.7-27.8% of COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission. 4 Abnormal findings in echocardiography are also found with 55% of COVID-19 patients during their initial hospital admission, including 39% of left ventricle (LV) and 33% of right ventricle (RV) abnormalities. 16 In contrast, data from China suggest that approximately 7% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop cardiac injury, defined as elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I or new echocardiographic, ECG abnormalities. 17 This prevalence increases to 25% in those hospitalised with COVID-19 18 and 22% in patients who required ICU admission. 17 Following these myocardial injuries, various cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and myocarditis, may follow.\\nCardiac arrhythmias are abnormal heartbeat rhythms that can manifest as tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat), bradycardia (an abnormally slow heartbeat) or irregular heartbeat. 19 Heart palpitations were the most common presenting symptom of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients who did not have a fever or cough. 20 In a study of 137 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, heart palpitations were reported in 10 (7.3%) cases. 21 Amongst 138 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, cardiac arrhythmias were seen in 16.7% of all patients and were more prevalent in ICU admitted cases. 17 In a study of 85 fatal cases with COVID-19, cardiac arrhythmias were found in 51 (60%) cases. 22 Life-threatening arrhythmias were also reported in 11 (5.9%) of 187 COVID-19 patients. 4 Myocarditis is a complication of COVID-19 that refers to inflammation of the heart muscle. 23 Segmental wall motion abnormalities or a reduced LV ejection fraction has been reported, although it is not specific for COVID-19, and also found in acute coronary syndrome. Amongst 68 fatal COVID-19 cases, 5 patients (7%) with myocarditis and circulatory failure were identified, whilst 22 patients (33%) had myocarditis and respiratory failure. 24 A systematic review of 14 cases of COVID-19-related myocarditis included 58% of male with the median age of 50.4 years and showed that the most prevalent comorbidity associated with myocarditis was hypertension (33%). 25 ECG findings varied from case to case, but troponin elevation was seen in 91% of cases. Of the patients who underwent echocardiography, 60% had a reduced ejection fraction. The overall survival rate was 81%, and survival rate in those who received steroids was 85%.\\nHeart failure is a condition where cardiac output is insufficient to meet the oxygen demand for the body. Heart failure can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a result of acute coronary syndrome (following plaque rapture) or the mismatch between oxygen supply and demand because of hypoxic respiratory failure or viral cardiomyopathy. 26 This complication is characterised by an increase in serum NT-proBNP and a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction. 27 In a study of 799 patients with COVID-19, heart failure was reported in 24% of all patients and in 49% of those who died. 22 Amongst 191 COVID-19 patients, heart failure affected 23% of all patients and 52% of those who died. 28 Clinical consequences of cardiovascular disease in acute COVID-19\\nFor the most part, the acute onset of cardiovascular injury because of COVID-19 is associated with a poor overall prognosis. 17, 18 For example, COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury had a higher mortality than those without cardiac injury during hospitalisation: 51.2% vs. 4.5% 29 or 59.6% vs. 8.9% respectively. 4 Similarly, elevated cardiac biomarkers were associated with a poor COVID-19 prognosis. Amongst 41 COVID-19 patients, 5 (12%) had acute cardiac injury, of whom 4 were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 5 A study of 138 hospitalised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 found cardiac injury in 10 patients (7.2%), almost all of whom required ICU care. 17 A study of 191 COVID-19 patients reported that 33 (17%) cases developed acute myocardial injury, of which 32 patients died. 28 In another cohort of 416 COVID-19 patients, cardiac injury occurred in 19.7% of patients during hospitalisation, and cardiac injury was identified as an independent risk factor for in-hospital motality. 29 These findings suggest that acute myocardial injury could be associated with severity and mortality for in-hospital COVID-19 patients.\\nAt present, no specific treatment is available for COVID-19-induced cardiovascular disease. However, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic there was significant concern that the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for either de novo or preexisting cardiovascular disease would increase COVID-19 severity. This was based on the suggestion that ACEi/ARB can increase the level of ACE-2 and thereby facilitate increased SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, when limited to a hypertensive subgroup, a recent meta-analysis showed a significant association between reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition and reduced risk of death. 30 This most likely reflects the vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects associated with increased ACE-2 expression, which acts to counterbalance the renin-angiotensin system by degrading angiotensin II. 31, 32 However, this mechanism of action remains speculative and the exact role of RAAS inhibition in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be defined.\\nDuring acute COVID-19, cardiovascular disease may arise as the direct consequence of viral infection or as an indirect result of inflammation and respiratory distress ( Figure 1 ). In terms of direct viral infection, in vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently infect and replicate in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) by binding to ACE-2. [33] [34] [35] [36] In contrast, human pluripotent stem cell-derived smooth muscle cells are refractory to infection. 34 SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-CMs results in cessation of beating, 33 cell death, 34, 36 impaired electrophysiological function, 34 transcriptional and morphological signatures of damage 35 and impaired contractile function, 34, 36 all of which may contribute to cardiovascular disease in vivo. However, the in vivo evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart remains equivocal. In autopsy and endomyocardial biopsy specimens from 4 COVID-19 patients, viral protein was detected by immunostaining in cardiomyocytes but not cardiac macrophages, fibroblasts or endothelial cells. 36 Similarly, in autopsies of 39 patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the myocardium of 24 patients, whilst negative sense RNA (indicative of active viral replication) was only detected in the myocardium of the 5 patients with the highest virus load. 37 An autopsy study of a further 41 patients showed that whilst SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the hearts of a large number of patients (n = 30), SARS-CoV-2 + cells in the myocardium were rare. 38 In contrast to these findings, amongst autopsy specimens from five COVID-19 patients no viral antigens could be detected in the heart, although all patients displayed severe myofibrillar anomalies. 35 Similarly, in 8 COVID-19 autopsies SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the heart of any patient by in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry or qRT-PCR. 39 Therefore, the contribution of direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes to in vivo pathogenesis remains unclear.\\nWhen considering the consequences of direct viral infection of the heart, it is important to recognise that the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE-2, plays an integral role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In the RAS signalling pathway, ACE and ACE-2 play opposing roles. On the one hand, ACE converts Ang I to Ang II in order to induce vasoconstrictive, pro-oxidative and proinflammatory effects. 31, 32, 40 On the other hand, Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the putative mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 in myocardium (1) to enter the target cell. This causes downregulation of ACE-2, which converts vasoconstricting/inflammatory angiotensin II into vasodilating/anti-inflammatory protein angiotensin 1-7. The concentration of angiotensin 1-7 decreases and that of angiotensin II increases, contributing to reduced coronary artery flow, myocardial ischaemia (2) and inflammation. Increased angiotensin II also cause vasoconstriction at the alveolar-capillary bed, leading specific increased strain on a right heart that is already struggling because of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and micro vascular thromboses. 52 Cell injury such as myocardial fibrosis (3) and apoptosis (4) is caused by both direct viral involvement and systemic inflammation from an imbalance of T helper 1 and 2 responses, denoted by elevated serum cytokines (5), 5 facilitating long-term disease including arrhythmias (6) and hypercoagulability. Increased cardiometabolic demand leads to a reduced cardiac reserve, denoted by compensative left ventricular hypertrophy (7), further contributing to angiotensin-aldosterone system dysregulation. Therapies used during the acute phase of infection, such as high-dose steroid treatment, may increase plaque formation (8) and hypertension and decrease cardiac function. High-dose steroid also could work as a stress hormone, inducing excess catecholamine, leading to excess oxygen consumption of myocardium and decrease cardiac function. 53 Cardiac injury results in elevated cardiac troponin (CTN) and NT-pro BNP levels (5). All mechanisms promote plaque destabilisation and increase wall shear stress (10) . 54 The image was created with Biorender.com. ACE-2 degrades Ang II to Ang (1-7) resulting in the prevention of hypertension, fibrosis, inflammation, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 41 SARS-CoV-2 binds and internalises ACE-2 upon infection contributing to an increase in Ang II levels and, as a result, an increase in Ang II-induced biological effects, making COVID-19 patients more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases. 27 This dysregulation of the RAS may occur in conjunction with virus-induced cardiovascular damage and systemic inflammation, the combination of which may increase the development of de novo cardiovascular complications. Indeed, the role of ACE-2 in both viral replication and RAS may explain why SARS-CoV-2 induces a higher rate of cardiac complications than other pneumonia-inducing viral infections (which do not bind to ACE-2) such as seasonal influenza virus. 42, 43 SARS-CoV-2 infection also induces a systemic inflammatory response, which may contribute to myocardial injury. 5 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 pathogen association molecular patterns (PAMPS) and\\ndanger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) in the lung results in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs) and induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Whilst serving to reduce viral replication and spread, a dysregulated proinflammatory response or 'cytokine storm' will itself culminate in tissue damage by attracting more cytokine-secreting cells to the lung and triggering epithelial cell apoptosis/necrosis. This pulmonary inflammatory response is further perpetuated in the vasculature where endothelial cells, although not directly infected with SARS-CoV-2, sense the viral infection in the adjacent epithelial cells and mount an inflammatory response. 13 The local and systemic cytokine profile during COVID-19 includes IL-6, IL-10, IL-1b, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), IFNs (IFN-a/b, IFN-c) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). 5, 44 This cytokine storm can cause acute cardiac injury through a variety of different mechanisms. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 have a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility. 23 Furthermore, TNFa-induced continuous activation of inflammatory signalling can cause widespread cardiomyocyte apoptosis, leading to pathological remodelling of the left ventricle and, ultimately, acute heart failure. 23 Alternatively, in particular amongst patients with underlying comorbidities, inflammation may trigger cardiovascular disease by triggering the rupture of the coronary atherosclerotic plaques. 45 Finally, this inflammatory response may not be independent of viral infection of the heart. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart would not only augment cardiovascular inflammation, but the resultant downregulation of ACE-2 would also serve to further perpetuate the inflammatory response. 27, 46, 47 In addition to systemic inflammation, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 indirectly contributes to cardiovascular disease via the induction of respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia, with resultant hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. 48 Long-term hypoxia causes myocardial cell injuries and necrosis, as well as cardiac arrhythmias. 4, 49, 50 Specifically, cardiomyocytes undergo cell membrane destruction as a result of intracellular acidosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production caused by decreased blood oxygen and energy supply (hypoxemia). 51 Hypoxemia also induces an influx of calcium ions, which contributes to cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis. 51 Alternatively, it is possible that viral pneumonia and the often-associated pulmonary thromboembolisms result in RV abnormalities.\\nAt present, it remains unclear how long the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 can persist in convalescent individuals ( Figure 2 ). Hospitalisation for bacterial pneumonia is associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. 55 In contrast, the cardiovascular complications associated with acute avian influenza (including tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and ST changes) resolve within 1 year of infection. 56 The limited number of studies performed on the long-term complications of COVID-19 suggests that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease may vary depending upon the patient population in question. Studies such as the long-term impact in intensive care survivors of coronavirus disease-19 (AFTERCOR study -ACTRN12620000799954p) 57 may shed light upon this.\\nAmongst individuals who experienced severe COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalised during the acute phase of disease), signs of persistent cardiovascular disease appear to be relatively common. For example, 21% of previously hospitalised COVID-19 patients still experienced chest pain 60 days postsymptom onset. 58 At 6 months post-infection, 9% of previously hospitalised COVID-19 patients continue to experience heart palpitations, whilst a further 5% experienced chest pain. 59 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) showed that amongst 148 patients recovering from severe COVID-19 (median follow-up time post-symptom onset = 68 days), 11% of patients had abnormal left ventricular function, whilst 19% of patients had myocardial infarction and 54% of patients had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) or ischaemia. 60 LGE indicates myocardial fibrosis, which is important because LGE may play a role in the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, 61, 62 eventually leading to impaired cardiac contraction. 63 Of patients with ischaemic injury pattern, 66% (27/41) had no history of coronary disease. CMR of another COVID-19 patient cohort (where the average duration from hospital discharge was 102 days) showed\\nLGE in approximately 30% of convalescent COVID-19 patients. 64 These findings are consistent with smaller studies (n = 26) where 31% of patients with a history of COVID-19 hospitalisation displayed LGE. 65 The prevalence of LGE is of particular concern given that LGE is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality in myocarditis. 64 The incidence of cardiovascular complications amongst convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced a mild illness is less well defined. Recently, the long-term complications of COVID-19 were investigated amongst 73 435 users of the Veteran Health Administration (VHA). 66 All convalescent COVID-19 patients experienced a mild, acute disease (i.e. patients were not hospitalised) with a median follow-up time of 126 days post-symptom onset. 66 Compared to approximately 4 million COVID-19-negative VHA users, a history of COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with an excess burden of hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, circulatory signs and Amongst studies of patients initially hospitalised with severe COVID-19, signs of persistent cardiovascular disease appear to be relatively common, with patients continuing to suffer from chest pain, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), LV dysfunction, myocardial infarction and palpitations 6 months post-infection. Cardiovascular complication incidence amongst convalescent COVID-19 patients who experienced mild illness is less well defined, with patients suffering from cardiac involvement, myocarditis and LGE earlier post-infection but seeming to recover by 6 months post-infection. Considering that some cases with mild illness still have cardiovascular complications at 6 months post-infection, 66 it cannot be concluded that mild cases of COVID-19 never cause chronic cardiac complications. The image was created with Biorender.com. symptoms, chest pain, coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure. 66 Amongst COVID-19 convalescent patients, there was also evidence of excess use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics and antiarrhythmics. 66 These data suggest that (1) the cardiac risk and associated burden of post-acute sequelae are evident even among individuals who did not require hospitalisation at acute phase (representing the majority of people with COVID- 19) and (2) the cardiac risk and associated burden increase across the severity spectrum of acute COVID-19 infection (from non-hospitalised to hospitalised individuals, to those admitted to intensive care). 66 These findings have been echoed in several smaller scale studies. Amongst 100 convalescent COVID-19 patients (follow-up time > 2 weeks post-symptom onset), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed that 78% of patients had cardiac involvement and 60% had ongoing myocardial inflammation. 67 Strikingly, the presence of cardiovascular disease was independent of time from the original diagnosis, pre-existing conditions and the severity and course of the acute illness, raising concerns that cardiovascular disease may emerge in patients who only experienced mild or even asymptomatic COVID-19. 67 Consistent with this notion, amongst 26 competitive college athletes who had recovered from mild COVID-19 (11-53 days postsymptom onset) four athletes had CMR findings consistent with myocarditis, whilst 12 athletes had LGE. 68 In contrast to these findings, no significant long-term cardiovascular complications were recorded in healthcare workers (n = 74) 6 months following a mild COVID-19 infection. 69 Specifically, compared with seronegative healthcare workers there was no significant changes in cardiac structure, function, tissue characterisation or biomarkers of individuals with a history of COVID-19 infection.\\nAt present, the mechanisms by which COVID-19 may cause long-term cardiovascular disease remains purely speculative. Elevated cytokine levels have been detected in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients, including elevated levels of pro-angiogenic MIP-1b, BDNF and VEGF. 70, 71 Whether this is sufficient to drive cardiovascular dysfunction, or is indicative of other underlying inflammation that then plays a causative role in cardiovascular disease, remains to be determined. Alternatively, it is possible that therapies used during the acute phase of illness (such as high-dose steroid treatment) have longterm consequences, as was previously observed with SARS-CoV-1. 72, 73 However, such a hypothesis would fail to explain the incidence of cardiovascular disease in convalescent individuals who had mild COVID-19. Recovered COVID-19 patients may have increased cardiometabolic demand, as previously described in SARS-CoV-1 survivors, resulting in reduced cardiac reserve and dysregulation of the angiotensin-aldosterone system. 8 Myocardial fibrosis or scarring (resulting from the acute inflammatory response or viral infection) may also facilitate long-term disease, including re-entrant arrhythmias. 8 The current clinical consensus is not to advise the routine use of advanced cardiac imaging in convalescent COVID-19 patients. It is vital that research in this field continues to define which patients are most at-risk of long-term cardiovascular disease so that targeted cardiovascular follow-up can be performed.\\nDuring SARS-CoV-2 infection, myocardial injury and cardiovascular complications are more common than other pneumonia-inducing viral infections and this often leads to poor outcomes. Acute cardiac complications include arrhythmia, myocarditis and heart failure. Direct myocardial injuries can be caused by the invasion of the virus itself in patients with underlying comorbidities. Indirect myocardial injuries can be caused by systemic inflammation because of the cytokine storm, causing a negative inotropic effect on cardiac contractility, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and acute heart failure. Long-term cardiac complications include hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure. As the mechanism of long-term complications, hypoxia, cytokines, increased cardiac metabolism and myocardial fibrosis might be related. Whilst the incidence of the long-term complications is independent of the severity of the acute illness, studies to determine which patients are most atrisk of long-term cardiovascular disease are vital so that targeted cardiovascular follow-up can be performed.\", 'A secular decline in entrepreneurial activity has characterized the US economy in recent years Decker, 2016; Hathaway, 2014 and Decker, 2017 . Along this downward trend, this paper provides empirical evidence showing that the short-run fluctuations of US net business formation have turned more volatile, procyclical and persistent after the global financial crisis of 2007-08. Changes in both establishment entry and exit have contributed to these new cyclical patterns of business formation, making the role of the extensive margin much more relevant for US business cycles than what it was during the Great Moderation period.\\nFollowing Melitz (2008, 2012) , there has been a renewed interest in studying the extensive margin of aggregate fluctuations. Our paper contributes to this growing literature. Building on Lewis and Poilly (2012) , Lewis and Stevens (2015) and LaCroce and Rossi (2018) , we consider a sticky-price model with variable number of firms, and extend the analysis to account for the above mentioned stylized facts. 1 Lewis and Poilly (2012) consider the extensive margin in a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze monetary policy and business cycles. In addition, Lewis and Stevens (2015) provide a quantitative exploration of the extensive margin of activity by estimating a DSGE-style model with Bayesian methods. LaCroce and Rossi (2018) include financial frictions and a banking sector with monopolistically competitive retail banks. More recently, Hamano and Zanetti (2018) focus on the effect of product quality and variety due to firm entry for the cyclical properties of inflation and the volatility of business cycle fluctuations. 2 However, as a common feature, these papers assume a constant rate of exit which leaves business formation mostly driven by fluctuations in the rate of entry. The variability in the rate of exit observed in the data is clearly at odds with the constant rate of exit rate formulation.\\nHence, the first contribution of our paper on the modelling side is to introduce an intertemporal exit rate decision that takes into account the liquidation value of the firm and expected dividends. Remarkably, while the entry of new firms (or new varieties of consumption goods) has been widely considered in DSGE models, few papers have proposed an analysis of firm exit. 3 Recently, Chugh and Cavallari (2015) , Cavallari (2015) , Zanetti (2017 , 2020 ) , and Rossi (2019) have proposed endogenous exit of firms motivated by reasons different than ours. 4 These attempts, however, turn out to be not satisfactory in addressing the stylized facts in the post-2008 financial crisis period. In Hamano and Zanetti (2017) , for example, the exit decision is based upon the current value of profits and it does not consider any liquidation cost associated with exit. This feature makes the exit decision intratemporal . In another recent paper, Cavallari (2015) considers scrap values, which are time-invariant and firm specific, in the exit decision. Rossi (2019) assumes that the liquidation value is zero. By contrast, we introduce heterogeneity through both firm-specific productivity and a time-varying liquidation value. This formulation has the advantage that we can assess how both the heterogeneity of incumbents and changes in the liquidation value can shape the intertemporal exit decision. 5 In our model, the exit rate depends on the productivity threshold that compares a firm\\'s continuation value with its liquidation value. At the end of the production period, the business unit remains in the industry if the present value of all expected dividends exceeds the liquidation value. 6 In the opposite case, the business unit exits the industry, the production of its variety ends and there is business destruction.\\nFor a quantitative evaluation of the role of the extensive margin for US aggregate fluctuations, we conduct a Bayesian estimation of our model with US quarterly data between 1993 and 2018. The extended model performs well on replicating business creation and destruction observed in recent US data. In particular, the posterior estimates generate model simulations that provide a good match on the second-moment statistics of the US entry rates, exit rates and net business formation. In the variance decomposition, the sources of fluctuations for entry and exit are rather different. The entry rate fluctuations are mainly the consequence of demand-side shocks while supply-side shocks, by contrast, have a large impact on the exit rate. Shocks to the entry costs and to the liquidation value are additional sources of US aggregate fluctuations that are not accounted in conventional DSGE models. We find that they jointly explain 13% of the variability of the quarterly rate of growth of US real GDP.\\nOur estimation exercise also includes a variant of the model that assumes a constant exit rate. We find that the baseline model with both endogenous entry and exit outperforms the more standard constant exit rate model because it provides a better description of the joint dynamics of business creation and destruction. Besides, the overall fit of the estimated model to the data is superior when the exit behavior is endogenized.\\nOur business cycle analysis is mostly focused on the determinants of US aggregate fluctuations during the 2007-2018 period. In line with what is observed in the data, the dynamics of US business formation become important to explain US aggregate fluctuations after the financial crisis . The extensive margin of activity (number of incumbents) gains action due to larger and more persistent fluctuations in entry and exit. The estimated shock decomposition for US data identify technology shocks, risk-premium shocks and monetary policy shocks as the three main components that explain the changes in US GDP growth over the Great Recession. The important role of technology shocks to explain business cycle fluctuations during this episode has also been documented by Jermann and Quadrini (2012) and Zanetti, 2019 in the context of models without entry and exit. The importance of risk-premium shocks during the Great Recession was also established in Christiano et al. (2014) . Additionally, we identify monetary policy shocks capturing the two waves of conventional and unconventional monetary expansions of the US Federal Reserve (in 2007-09 and 2013-15 , respectively) with significant effects for GDP growth and business formation.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the empirical motivation of our paper and outlines the key stylized facts on US business formation. Section 3 presents the extended DSGE model with a special focus on the processes of business creation and destruction. Section 4 introduces the Bayesian estimation strategy and provides the posterior estimates of the DSGE model with extensive margin for the US economy, including a validation exercise based on the empirical fit of second-moment statistics. Section 5 presents the main analysis and proceeds with the discussion of results. Section 6 concludes with the summary of the most relevant findings of the paper.\\nThe Business Employment Dynamics report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides business data in \\'establishment\\' units, which refer to \"the physical location of a certain economic activity-for example, a factory, mine, store, or office. A single establishment generally produces a single good or provides a single service.\". 7 Our choice of establishments to measure business formation is due to the fact that other candidates such as firms or enterprises may be the collection of multiple establishments. 8 The creation or destruction of establishments within multi-establishment firms would have no effect observed on the extensive margin in the data. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of the rate of growth of Total Private Establishments (TPE) per capita and the rates of establishment entry and exit for the total sample period , and for the subsamples that belong to either the Great Moderation (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) or the Great Recession (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) . 9 The rate of entry is calculated as the percent ratio between private sector establishment births and TPE, whereas the rate of exit is the percentage of establishment deaths over TPE.\\nThe mean value of the three variables fell during the Great Recession compared to the Great Moderation period. In fact, the average value of the quarterly rate of growth of TPE per capita becomes virtually null during the Great Recession (0.0%) from a 0.21% value during the Great Moderation. The decline of the entry rate strongly contributes to the fall of the average quarterly business formation as its mean falls from 3.39% to 3.00%. 10 The exit rate also falls, although it does so to a lesser extent from an average of 2.98% in 1993-2006 to 2.83% in the Great Recession. Table 1 shows some remarkable stylized facts on the second-moment statistics. The extensive margin of aggregate fluctuations (measured by the percent variations in TPE) turns more volatile, more procyclical with respect to real GDP growth (both at the same quarter and with a one-quarter lag), and more persistent after the financial crisis of 2007-08. The standard deviation of TPE growth, its correlation with real GDP growth and its autocorrelation increase substantially between the Great Moderation and the Great Recession. 11 Table 1 also informs on stronger procyclical patterns of US net business formation when considering a one-quarter lag for real GDP growth possibly due to some time-to-build delay.\\nMeanwhile, the business cycle patterns of volatility, cyclicality and inertia of the entry rate evolve in a similar way to those of TPE growth (higher values that measure volatility, cross correlation with GDP growth and autocorrelation). The US entry rate is more procyclical with lagged real GDP growth than with contemporaneous real GDP growth which may 7 All the data from the Business Employment Dynamics report from the BLS are available for free access at https://www.bls.gov/bdm/ 8 The BLS indicates that \\'an enterprise (a private firm, government, or nonprofit organization) can consist of a single establishment or multiple establishments\\'. 9 The first section of the technical Appendix includes plots and some discussion of the time series of US quarterly data on business formation, entry and exit from 1993 to 2018. 10 This is a clear signal of the decline of entrepreneurial activity in the US economy (Decker, 2016) . As another piece of evidence, the average quarterly rate of growth of real GDP per capita within the whole sample period was 0.38%, whereas TPE growth per capita only grew at a quarterly average of 0.12%. 11 Notably, there was neither inertia nor cyclicality of TPE growth over the period 1993 to 2006 (the sample statistics on cyclical correlation and auctocorrelation are both zero). reflect the time-to-build requirements to create new businesses. Likewise, there are increasing patterns for the volatility and persistence of the exit rate fluctuations, and also a stronger negative comovement between the exit rate and real GDP growth during the Great Recession period. Table 1 reports more substantial changes in the standard deviation, and in the cyclical correlation of the exit rate than of the entry rate. Fig. 1 shows rolling-window statistics obtained from US quarterly data of 48 quarters per sample. There are striking patterns observed as the quarters of the Great Recession enter the sample. Hence, the series of TPE growth increases its volatility, procyclicality and persistence after 1997. Such increasing role of the extensive margin for aggregate fluctuations remains strong as the window rolls over time, with high values for the latest windows. As Fig. 1 displays, the changes in the second-moment statistics of the entry rate seems to be transitory (with peaks observed in the central subsamples between 1998 and 2009). Nevertheless, the exit rate still exhibits increased volatility, countercyclicality and persistence over the last years of the rolling window which indicates its relevance in explaining the role of the extensive margin (TPE growth) for US aggregate fluctuations.\\nTwo conclusions emerge from this empirical analysis that are useful to complete existing evidence on the increased volatility of the variables in the post financial crisis period (Doz et al. , 2020; Liu et al. , 2019 and Pizzinelli et al. , 2020) . First, the evolution of net business formation has become more volatile, sensitive to the cycle, and persistent. Second, both fluctuations in the entry rate and, especially, the exit rate contribute substantially to business formation fluctuations during the Great Recession. Therefore, the processes of business creation and destruction in the US have brought significant variations in the extensive margin of economic activity that may have effects on aggregate fluctuations. These aspects of the extensive margin have not yet been investigated. Towards this end, we present in the next section a DSGE model with richer entry and exit dynamics relative to the literature.\\nThe model represents an economy populated by households, firms, and the public sector (government and central bank). There are monopolistically competitive markets for goods and labor and perfectly competitive asset markets of capital, equity shares and government bonds. Households purchase bundles of consumption goods, set nominal wages, supply one specific labor service, own assets and decide on business creation and destruction. The number of varieties of consumption goods changes over time as a result of flows of entry and exit of firms producing differentiated goods. Hence, firms produce and set the price of their differentiated consumption good. For production, firms demand bundles of labor services and capital to be used in a Cobb-Douglas technology with firm-specific productivity.\\nFollowing the standard assumptions of DSGE models (Christiano et al. , 2005; Smets and Wouters, 2007) , nominal and real rigidities and frictions are considered to enhance the empirical fit of the model. The set of real rigidities include consumption habits, adjustment costs on investment, and variable capital utilization. Regarding nominal rigidities, we consider fixed probabilities of not being able to optimally adjust both prices and wages as in Calvo (1983) , combined with indexation rules that include inflationary shocks. 12\\nAs in Bilbiie et al. (2012) , each firm is specialized in the production of one specific good within a single location (establishment). It leads to a convenient setup in which the total number of goods, firms and establishments is the same and indexed within the same business unit. Therefore, in the model there is no distinction between firms, establishments or varieties of goods. Formally, there are n t−1 varieties of consumption goods (firms, establishments) at the end of period t − 1 . In period t , the production of n x t goods (equivalently, firms or establishments) shuts down and firms exit the market, while the remaining amount of n s t incumbents survive and continue operating in the market. Hence, we have\\nwhich implies the following exit rate\\nand its complementary survival rate 1 − x t = n s t /n t−1 .\\nHouseholds decide how much to invest in the creation of new firms (establishments) to produce differentiated consumption goods. 13 A one-period time-to-build is required for firm creation. Thus, the desired number of entries n e t must be decided as part of households optimal portfolio in period t − 1 . At the beginning of period t , the firm-specific productivity draws are released for all the new establishments. As we will show below, these draws determine the number of firms that survive. The number of effective entries at the end of the time-to-build period is the survival rate multiplied by the number of desired entries, ( 1 − x t ) n e t . Accordingly, applying the survival rate, 1 − x t , to both the active lines of production at the end of the previous period, n t−1 , and the new desired establishments, n e t , brings this law of motion\\nwhich gives the total number of productive firms at the beginning of period t, n t , as the number of incumbents that remain alive plus the effective number of entries. The rate of effective entry is defined as follows \\nThe definitions of both the effective entry rate, e t , and the exit rate, x t , imply that the rate of growth of the total number of firms (net business formation) coincides with the difference between the effective entry rate and the exit rate,\\nNext, let us describe separately the endogenous determination of the dynamics for entry and exit.\\nFollowing Bilbiie et al. (2012) , Cavallari (2015) , Lewis and Stevens (2015) , and Rossi (2019) , the free-entry decision is primarily based on the comparison between the prospective equity value and the cost of entry. Unlike these papers, however, the cost of entry is not obtained here from the marginal cost of production or from any specific production function. We 12 The model incorporates sticky prices a la Calvo (1983) instead of the Rotemberg (1982) \\'s price adjustment costs traditionally adopted in other papers with extensive margin. Cavallari (2015) also assumes Calvo (1983) -type price rigidity, however, in a calibrated model. 13 The technical appendix provides the details of the optimization problems for both households and firms.\\nassume that the cost of opening a new firm is a combination of its licence fee and start-up variable costs. In particular, we have the following specification to determine the unit cost of business creation in period t exp ( ε e t ) ( f e + e c t ) , where ε e t is an AR(1) exogenous entry cost shock, f e is the unit real cost of a license fee required by the government to begin the production of a new variety, and e c t is a variable congestion cost for start-ups which increases with the desired entry rate as follows\\nsetting parameter values e > 0 and ς e > 1 for convexity. 14 In the portfolio choice of the representative household (see technical Appendix), the first order conditions of the number of entries and equity investment are, respectively,\\nwhere λ t is the Lagrange multiplier of the budget constraint in period t, v t is the average (expected) equity value, β is the household discount factor, d t+1 is the expected dividend in period t + 1 if incumbents survive, and l v t+1 is the expected liquidation value in period t + 1 if incumbents die. As observed in the right hand side of conditions (6) and (7), the expected marginal benefit combines the returns in the scenarios of incumbents survival, E t n s t+1 n t ( d t+1 + v t+1 ) , and death, Combining (6) and (7) results in the free-entry equilibrium condition\\nwhich equates the marginal cost of entry to its expected marginal benefit. A log-linear approximation to the free entry condition (8) that incorporates the entry cost function (5) brings the following equation for log deviations of entry with respect to its steady state level\\nwhere v and e c are the steady-state levels for average equity and the congestion cost of entry, respectively. 15 Thus, households decide to raise their spending on the creation of new firms when they observe an increase in the average equity value, v t . Firm-specific productivity will be observed ex post and the expected return of new firms is the current average equity value. If there is an increase in the exogenous component of the cost of entry, ε e t , the number of new firms created by the households is going to fall. The elasticity of the congestion entry cost ς modulates the response of log fluctuations of desired entry , n e t+1 , to both driving factors, v t and ε e t . The first order condition for purchases of government bonds is\\nwhere r t is the real interest rate and ε b t is an exogenous risk-premium shock. Using it in (6) gives the equation that determines the equilibrium equity value\\nThe coefficients v i > 0 for i = 1 , . . . , 5 depend on the structural parameters. 16 14 The desired entry rate in period t is expressed as n e t+1 /n t because households decide on business creation one period in advance. 15 Throughout the paper, we follow the standard notation of variables topped with a hat sign \" \" to denote log fluctuations with respect to its level in the balanced-growth deterministic steady state, whereas variables with no time subscript denote the steady state level along such balanced-growth path. 16 In\\nwhere γ > 0 is the long-run rate of economic growth used in the detrended deterministic steady state.\\nFor the entry rate equation, we can take a semi-loglinear approximation to its definition (4), 17 and use the lagged version of the business creation dynamics (9) to obtain\\nwhere the value of v t−1 is provided by taking equation (10) with one lag.\\nThe exit decision is determined from rational behavior. The relative position of incumbents in terms of their productivity determines whether a single firm shuts down or continues with the production activity. As in Ghironi and Melitz (2005) , firms produce with a specific productivity drawn from a Pareto distribution. The productivity draw, z , is released after making the decision on entry and it remains the same for all future periods. The probability density function, g ( z ), of the Pareto distribution of productivity draws is\\nwhere z min is the minimum productivity and κ is a parameter that determines the concentration of establishments with low productivity (i.e., close to z min ). As proved in the technical Appendix, the average firm-level productivity is constant at the value\\n, which requires holding the technical constraint κ > θ p − 1 .\\nAt the end of the production period, each incumbent faces a survival test. Those goods produced under low-efficiency technologies are at risk of business termination due to the lack of profitability over the prospective business cycles. Concretely, if the present value of all expected dividends exceeds the liquidation value, the rational decision is to continue with the production for the next period. In the opposite case, the rational decision is to shut down the production of that variety.\\nHence, the representative firm ω at period t faces the following choice\\nβ is a discount factor that incorporates the steady-state survival rate, and l v t is the current liquidation value. At the margin, there would be a critical value of firm-level productivity, z cr t ( ω ) , for which the expected dividend stream exactly coincides with the liquidation value,\\nThe parity equation (12) holds for the representative firm at one critical value of specific productivity, z cr t ( ω ) . Assuming Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) \\'s monopolistic competition for firm-level demand curves, we can rewrite (12) as follows\\nwhere P t+ j ( ω ) /P c t+ j is the relative price in terms of the consumption bundle, y t+ j is the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate output. As proved in the technical Appendix, the critical value z cr t ( ω ) is embedded in the denominator of the real marginal cost,\\nwhich connects mc cr t+ j ( ω ) to the real marginal cost for the firm that produces with the average productivity, mc t+ j . Even though firm-specific productivity, z ( ω), is constant, it is worth noticing that its productivity threshold, z cr t ( ω ) , is time dependent due to the variability in expected relative prices, aggregate output, marginal costs, or the liquidation value that enter (12\\').\\nLet us define ρ t+ j ( ω ) = P t+ j ( ω ) /P c t+ j as the relative price in terms of consumption bundles in any t + j period. Using (13) and loglinearizing (12\\'), we can obtain the following forward-looking loglinear equation for the fluctuations of z cr t ( ω ) ,\\nwhere z i > 0 for i = 1 , . . . , 5 are coefficients that depend on the structural parameters. 18 Equation (14) shows that the value of log fluctuations in the average expected real marginal costs, mc t+1 , raises z cr t . This occurs because the expected dividends will be lower. By contrast, increases in the expected aggregate demand, y t+1 , and a higher expected unit revenue from sales, ρ t+1 , reduce z cr t as they both raise the average expected dividend. Finally, any increase in the current liquidation value relative to its next period\\'s expected value increases z cr t because of the higher return on exit.\\nThe liquidation value is obtained as the difference between the share, 1 − τ, with 0 < τ < 1, of the licence fee that is reimbursed by the government and a variable exit cost, x c t , with exogenous variations provided by an AR(1) shock, ε x t , as follows\\nwhere the cost of shutting down is determined by the increasing convex function of the exit rate \\nAlso as in Ghironi and Melitz (2005) , the critical productivity splits up the fraction of establishments that survive from those that exit at the end of period t , according to the properties of the Pareto distribution. Thus, the exit rate, x t = n x t /n t−1 , depends positively on the productivity threshold z cr\\nwhich, in semi-loglinear terms, implies that exit rate deviations are given by this expression\\nwhere κ ( 1 − x ) defines the semi-elasticity of the exit rate to the critical productivity.\\nThus, equations (14), (15) and (16) together govern the intertemporal exit dynamics of the model.\\nThe endogenous determination of the number of goods (firms, establishments), n t , allows for a distinction between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). The Dixit-Stiglitz aggregate price level provides the CPI from the aggregation of prices across the differentiated goods\\nNext, let P t denote the PPI in period t , obtained as the average price across firms producing with the average productivity, z . As shown in the technical Appendix, both price indices are related as follows 19\\nHence, the price of the consumption bundle, P c t , increases with the producer price index P t , and decreases with the number of goods n t . Provided the definition of the average relative price, ρ t = P t /P c t , relation (17) brings a variety effect that implies a higher value for ρ t (unit revenue for the firm with average productivity) when there is a higher value on the number of goods, n t , 18 The detailed derivation is available in the technical appendix. It should be noticed that in the original non-linear relationships that determine z cr\\nthere are differences depending upon the relative firm-specific productivity and the history of pricing. Such wedges are constant proportions and do not show up after taking the loglinear approximations. The structural coefficients of (14) are\\nSee the technical appendix for further details. 19 Recalling the definitions of both the CPI and the PPI, equation (17) can be divided by its lagged version to bring a link between the rate of CPI inflation, π c t , and that of PPI inflation, π t , through the change in the number of goods:\\nwith elasticity at θ p − 1 −1 that depends inversely on the Dixit-Stiglitz demand elasticity.\\nFirms set prices conditional to a Calvo (1983) nominal rigidity scheme. Hence, there is a fixed probability 0 < ξ p < 1 that the firm cannot set the optimal prices. If that is the case, the firm will automatically adjust the price by applying an indexation rule that depends on lagged inflation (with a weight ι p ), and on the steady state rate of inflation affected by a price-push exogenous shock, ε p t (with a weight 1 − ι p ). The PPI rate of inflation is π t = P t − P t−1 , evaluated at the firms that produce with the average productivity z . As proved in the technical Appendix, the PPI inflation equation (the New Keynesian Phillips curve) of the model is\\nwhere mc t denotes the log deviation of their real marginal cost with respect to the steady-state level, and ρ t is the log fluctuation of relative prices defined above. The inflation dynamics provided by (19) are hybrid between backward-looking due to the indexation rule on lagged inflation and forward-looking due to nominal rigidities on price setting. The gap between fluctuations of the real marginal cost and relative prices, mc t − ρ t , drive inflation variability with a slope coefficient inversely determined by the Calvo probability ξ p . The increase in the number of goods n t has some deflationary effect because of its relation to relative prices ρ t (variety effect). Finally, the term on the price-push shock, ε p\\n, brings the exogenous source for inflation variability.\\nMonetary policy is described by a Taylor, 1993 -type rule, of the kind used in standard DSGE models. Thus, we follow Smets and Wouters (2007) and consider that the central bank adjusts the nominal interest rate to stabilize inflation and both the current and the change in the output gap, with a partial-adjustment pattern that includes lagged nominal interest rate to smooth down monetary policy actions,\\nwhere μ π > 1.0, μ y , μ y ≥ 0, and 0 ≤ μ R < 1 is the policy smoothing parameter. Both the nominal interest rate and PPI inflation enter (20) as level deviations with respect to their steady state values. The central bank targets PPI inflation π t , (and not CPI inflation π c t that shapes the real interest rate) because optimal monetary policy in a sticky-price framework with business formation must stabilize the rate of inflation of producer prices (Bilbiie et al. , 2008) . As usual ingredients of monetary policy rule in models with sticky prices, y t − y p t is the output gap between the cyclical component of output ( y t ) and its potential (natural-rate) realization ( y p t ), and ε R t is an exogenous monetary policy shock. 20 Regarding the role of the government, its fiscal policy consists of holding the budget constraint,\\nwhich implies that the exogenous public expenditures on consumption goods, ε g t , are financed within the period by either collecting lump-sum taxes, t t , by obtaining net revenues from selling operating licenses, exp ε e t f e n e t+1 − exp ε x t (1 − τ ) f e n x t + n x t /n t−1 n e t , and by selling newly issued bonds b t that yield the real return exp ε b t ( 1 + r t ) in the equilibrium of the bonds market.\\nUsing (18) in the Dixit-Stiglitz demand constraint, y t = ( ρ t ) −θp y t , aggregate output can be related to the average establishment-level production as follows\\nwhere noticing n θ p θ p −1 t = n t n 1 θ p −1 t and plugging the expression for relative prices, ρ t , implied by (18), aggregate output can be decomposed as the number of establishments, n t , multiplied by firm-level production in terms of consumption bundles, ρ t y t , y t = n t ρ t y t .\\n20 Potential output is computed assuming fully-flexible prices set by firms and nominal wages set by households.\\nAs (23) indicates, aggregate output, y t , may have variations in either its extensive margin (the number of establishments, n t ), or in its intensive margin (the amount of production at the firm with average productivity, ρ t y t ). Finally, the equilibrium condition for the market of bundles of consumption goods (overall resources constraint) is,\\nwhich displays the uses of aggregate income, y t , on consumption expenditures, c t , on private investment on capital goods, i t , on the adjustments costs of variable capital utilization, a (u t ) k t−1 , on the exogenous net public spending that results from the fiscal policy, ε g t , on the total variable cost of planned entries, exp ε e t e c t n e t+1 , and -as a novelty of the setting -on the total variable cost of exits, exp ε x t x c t n x t n s t n t . 21\\nThe complete model with business formation is written for short-run fluctuations as the set of log-linearized dynamic equations available in the technical Appendix. 22 As one particular case of the baseline model, the variant with a constant exit rate can be obtained by replacing the business destruction block with an equation that fixes the establishment exit rate at its steady-state value, x t = x, and dropping both the variables related to the exit decision ( n x t , l v t , z cr t , and x c t ) and the liquidation value shock, ε x t . We will also estimate this constant exit rate model for a comparison with the baseline model to show the implications of endogenizing the exit dynamics in a DSGE model.\\nWe estimate the loglinearized DSGE model with entry and exit in Dynare using the Bayesian estimation routine (Adjemian et al. , 2011) with nine exogenous processes that bring model variability: seven AR(1) shocks on technology, riskpremium, interest rates (monetary policy), investment adjustment costs, fiscal policy, entry cost and liquidation value; and two ARMA(1,1) shocks pushing on prices and nominal wages, respectively, through the indexation rules. 23 The data used for the estimation consist of nine quarterly time series including the rates of establishment entry and exit obtained in the Business Employment Dynamics report mentioned in Section 2 . All the other observable series are comparable to those used in the estimation of the DSGE model by Smets and Wouters (2007) with three differences. First, the CPI has been used to deflate the nominal series to be consistent with the model. Secondly, per-capita series were computed dividing the aggregate series by the US working-age population adjusted by populational controls as released in the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of Labour Statistics (2013) . 24 And third, we have used the series of shadow nominal interest rate calculated by Wu and Xia, 2016 in order to accommodate the effects of the unconventional balance-sheet policy actions in the zero lower bound scenario of the Great Recession. 25 The constant exit rate model is also estimated excluding the series of establishment exit as observables because there is no liquidation value shock in the model. The sample period is constrained by data availability on US quarterly entry and exit, which runs from 1993:2 to 2018:4. Thus, we have 103 observations. Some standard underlying parameters are fixed before the estimation. Following Smets and Wouters, 2007 , the rate of capital depreciation is set at δ = 0 . 025 , the labor elasticity of substitution at θ w = 3 . 0 , and the government spending, ε g , is assumed to be 18% of aggregate output in steady-state, ε g = 0 . 18 y . In addition, the capital utilization rate is assumed to be equal to 100% in steady state ( u = 1 ), when there are no costs of variable capital utilization ( a (u ) = 0 ). The minimum firm-level productivity is normalized at z min = 1 . 0 . Finally, the parameter τ , which determines the share of sunk costs at entry (licence fee), is calibrated to imply that the total number of goods in steady state is normalized at n = 1 . This leads to choosing the value τ = 0 . 54 . Tables 2 and 3 display the priors and estimated posteriors found in the Bayesian estimation. The selection of priors mostly follows Lewis and Stevens (2015) and Smets and Wouters (2007) , and we only note here the few differences with these papers. The steady-state quarterly rate of exit is set at a prior of x = 2 . 91% (slightly higher than the value assigned by Lewis and Stevens, 2015 ) in order to match the mean value obtained in US data. Regarding the variable costs of business creation and destruction, we assume a quadratic specification in both cases with ς e = 2 and ς x = 2 . The size of these costs is controlled by their respective scale coefficents, e and x . Due to the uncertainty about these scale parameters, we have estimated the steady-state ratio of these entry and exit cost with respect to equity value. The priors are at 2%, ie., 21 Budget constraints for both the households and the government are taken into account for the derivation of the overall resources constraint (see the technical Appendix for the proof). 22 The non-linear system of equations that determines the balanced-growth solution in steady state is also available in the technical appendix. 23 The choice of ARMA(1,1) processes for these two shocks follows Smets and Wouters (2007) . It is a useful one as it allows us to capture the stickiness and persistency of prices and wages through the moving average component without the need of estimating a high number of parameter as in the case of an AR(n) process. 24 Hence, the observed time series obtained for the estimation are the establishment entry rate, the establishment exit rate, the log difference in percapita real GDP, the log difference in per-capita real Personal Consumption Expenditures, the log difference in per-capita real Private Fixed Investment, the log difference in the real wage obtained from the Average Hourly Earnings in the Nonfarm Business Sector, the rate of change in the GDP price deflator, the Wu and Xia (2016) \\'s shadow Federal Funds rate, and the log of Hours of per worker obtained as the product between the Average Weekly Hours and Civilian Employment divided by the Civilian Labor Force. The sources to obtain these series are the Business Employment Report from the BLS and the FRED database compiled by the St. Louis Fed. The measurement equations and data definitions are available in the technical appendix. 25 A recent paper by Ikeda et al. (2020) outlines several issues related to the estimation of models at the zero lower bound and formulates a shadow rate for monetary policy. \\nOnce the posterior estimates are found, these nubmers will be used to pin down the implied values of e and x in the steady state solution of the model. Finally, the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution κ takes a prior of 5.0, sufficiently high to meet the condition of the Pareto distribution for a well-behaved average productivity, κ > θ p − 1 .\\nThe posterior estimates, from both the baseline model and the constant exit rate model, are reported in Tables 2 and 3 . As reported in Table 2 :\\n• The estimate of the coefficient on household risk aversion, σ c , is low (0.77), falling significantly below its prior value (1.5), and also lower than the number obtained when assuming a constant exit rate (0.94). Subsequently, the elasticity of consumption intertemporal substitution turns higher when extending the DSGE model with entry and exit. The procyclicality of business formation following changes in the real interest rate can explain this result.\\n• The baseline model delivers a lower estimate of price stickiness ( ξ p at 0.95) relative to that of wage stickiness ( ξ w at 0.98), while in the model with a fixed exit rate there is slightly more price stickiness ( ξ p at 0.96) than wage stickiness ( ξ w at 0.95). In both cases, the estimated Calvo probabilities for price and wage stickiness are numbers close to 1.0, which is consistent with the flattening of the inflation equation (New Keynesian Phillips curve) observed in recent US business cycles (Casares and Vazquez, 2018) . Furthermore, our model does not feature Kimball (1995) \\'s aggregator for consumption varieties which would reduce significantly the slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve as in Smets and Wouters, 2007 . In addition, there is a variety effect through the introduction of relative prices in the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (19), which may play some role on inflation volatility.\\n• The posterior mean estimate of the Dixit-Stiglitz demand elasticity in the baseline model is lower than its prior at θ p = 2 . 56 . This result implies a mark-up in steady state at 64% (substantially higher than the numbers typically used in the calibration of DSGE models (for example, θ p = 6 to have a 20% steady-state mark-up of prices over marginal costs) but The estimation method requires a small value for θ p in order to replicate the relative variability of business formation with respect to real GDP fluctuations observed in US data. In other words, a value of θ p around 6 or higher would bring excessive volatility of business formation.\\n• Regarding the parameters that characterize entry and exit dynamics, the elasticity of the entry congestion costs is in steady state. They imply e = 9 , 773 . 48 and x = 6 , 471 . 98 . In the model with constant exit rate, the posterior estimate of the entry cost ratio is slightly lower at 2.51%, and no exit costs are assumed, resulting in a value for the scale parameter of the entry cost at e = 4 , 299 . 06 . The posterior estimate of the shape parameter in the Pareto distribution is above its prior at κ = 6 . 69 , although it is still substantially lower than the number used in the calibration proposed by Hamano and Zanetti (2017) for a model without an intertemporal approach in the exit decision. 27 Our posterior estimates imply a critical firm-level productivity in steady state at z cr = 1 . 0047 (0.47% higher than the minimum productivity z min = 1 . 00 ), and an average productivity at z = 1 . 19 (19% higher than the minimum productivity). The parameters of volatility and persistence that characterize the exogenous processes of the estimated models are reported in Table 3 . Technology shocks are less persistent in the extended DSGE model than in the model without business formation. Risk-premium shocks have innovations with lower standard deviation but their estimated inertia is larger than in the model without entry and exit. Specific shocks on entry and exit have moderate inertia, ρ e = 0 . 49 and ρ x = 0 . 69 , more remarkable for liquidation value shocks. In the comparison between the estimated shock parameters of the baseline model and the constant exit rate model, we do not find any remarkable difference. We discuss and compare the role of these shocks as sources of variability below in the impulse-response and variance decomposition analyses. Table 4 reports a selection of second-moment statistics obtained from model simulations and their comparison to actual statistics from US data:\\nThe estimated model replicates quite well the statistics of the observable series on volatility (standard deviations), cyclical correlation (cross correlation with output growth) and persistence (coefficient of autocorrelation). Both in the simulated series of the baseline model and in US data, the rate of growth of firms-establishments ( n t ) and both the entry rates ( e t ) and the exit rates ( x t ) are less volatile but more persistent than aggregate output growth. Table 4 shows an excessive persistence on business growth when comparing the results of the model with US data. 28 Looking at cross correlations with output growth, both net business formation and the entry rate are procyclical both in the models and the data. Taking a one-quarter lag of output growth, the correlation of business creation rises substantially in the baseline model with endogenous entry and exit (the coefficients of correlation increase from 0.18 to 0.57 in the case of the entry rate and from 0.30 to 0.53 for the establishments growth), similarly to what it is observed in US data (see Table 4 ). The model with constant exit rate brings only a little procyclicality of business formation with lower numerical values for the cross correlations of either the establishment growth or the entry rate with output.\\nThe exit rate is countercyclical with a negative correlation with output growth at -0.28 in the model (matching closely with the value of -0.30 observed in US data). The numbers in Table 4 do not indicate the presence of greater delayed 27 Hamano and Zanetti (2017) assume κ = 11 . 51 . One reason for the gap between their value and our posterior estimate can be that they choose κ to match the average US product destruction rate (6%), which is more than two times higher than the average US establishment exit rate considered here. 28 The reason is that both the entry rate and the exit rate are quite persistent in the data and the observed rate of growth of establishments is the difference between them. Having both the entry rate and the exit rate as observables leads to long inertia for net business formation in the estimated model. responses of business destruction to GDP growth in both the model and the data. If the assumption of a constant exit rate is considered, the lack of fluctuations of the exit results in a zero standard deviation and a zero cross correlation with output growth. For a model comparison in the overall capacity to fit the data, we have looked at the log data density (Laplace approximation) provided as part of Dynare estimation results. The baseline model gives a value of −426 . 87 , higher than the value of −428 . 13 obtained after the estimation of the constant exit rate model. Therefore, the data-generating structure of the baseline model with endogenous entry and exit is superior to the constant exit rate model to replicate US business cycle data. 29\\nOur model can account for aggregate fluctuations driven by the extensive margin adjustment since changes in the number of business units have an impact on aggregate output. Each business unit (firm, establishment) produces a single differentiated variety of consumption. We can define firm-level output as the amount y t produced by the establishment that operates with average productivity z , which in terms of consumption bundles of is\\nIntroducing y f t in the composition of aggregate output (23) yields y t = n t y f t where taking logs and the first difference leads to the decomposition of the rate of growth of aggregate output\\nbetween the contributions of the extensive margin, n t , and the intensive margin, y f t .\\nWe discuss here the dynamics of the number of firms and its influence on aggregate fluctuations in response to typical examples of either a supply-side shock or a demand-side shock. For the supply-side shock we show the effects of a total factor productivity (technology) innovation in Figure 2 . For a demand-side shock, Fig. 3 displays the responses following a exogenous increase in the risk-premium. The size of the shocks have been normalized at the values of their corresponding estimated standard deviations reported in Table 3 . We have decided to show the impulse-response functions after technology and risk-premium shocks because they take the highest shares in the variance decomposition of the rate of growth of the total number of firms (see the column labeled n in Table 5 ), which make them the main sources for fluctuations of the extensive margin in the US. 30 Fig. 2 . Impulse-response functions following a technology shock. As Fig. 2 shows, a technology shock increases the entry rate and reduces the exit rate, which results in a positive variation in the total number of firms. 31 Although the intensive margin (average firm-level production) takes the initial stand to bring aggregate output growth, the gradual response of the extensive margin (number of firms) turns dominant a few quarters after the shock. Thus, the extensive margin amplifies the effect of a technology shock because of the procyclical reaction of net business formation. The average production of incumbents falls below its steady-state threshold value several quarters after the shock, which leaves an industry with more firms producing lower amounts of output. The positive effect on entry occurs because households invest on business creation as they observe an increase of equity value due to higher expected dividends and lower interest rates. The effective entry takes one period to be materialized on the goods market due to the time-to-build requirement. Meanwhile, the exit rate decreases. The positive technology shock lowers the critical productivity z cr because of a decrease in the expected real marginal cost, combined with a higher expected aggregate output and a higher expected unit revenue at the firms (see the dynamic equation for z cr , (14)). In Hamano and Zanetti (2017) \\'s flexible-price model with endogenous exit, this average firm-level productivity rises after an adverse technology shock. This result can be replicated in our model by reversing the sign of the shock displayed in Fig. 2 . 32 In the model with constant exit rate, the role of the extensive margin is weaker because the adjustement to the shock does not take into account the decrease in the rate of firms\\' exit for an almost similar increase in the rate of entry. Subsequently, establishments grow more slowly and the technology shock has a higher positive impact on firm-level production. Fig. 3 plots the responses obtained following a risk-premium shock. The effective real interest rate rises and aggregate demand shrinks as households reduce their desired spending on both consumption and investment goods. Such demand contraction results in a long-lasting decline of aggregate output, fed by the two margins as both the number of firms and the amount of firm-level output produced fall. The net business destruction is mostly explained by a procyclical reaction of entry because firm exit rises at the time of the shock but soon moves down to the negative side. 33 The persistent fall of business entry comes justified by the lower average equity value due to the combination of higher interest rates and lower expected dividends. Over the first quarters after the shock, the intensive margin absorbs the demand contraction and firms reduce their production with no significant business destruction. However, as time goes by, the number of establishments keeps falling because the effective firm entry needs more than 40 quarters to return to its steady state level. Thus, the model with entry and exit reports a longer recession after a risk-premium shock in comparison to a DSGE model with a constant exit rate in which the entry rate returns quicker to steady state and the exit rate does not change.\\nThe sources of variability of US real GDP growth and business entry-exit rates are captured in the variance decomposition of the estimated model. Table 5 reports the percent shares obtained for the contribution of each shock in the long-run variance decomposition (infinite forecasting horizon). The model with constant exit rate provides similar shares (see technical Appendix for the corresponding Table) .\\nDemand-side shocks govern most of the fluctuations of the rates of growth of both aggregate and firm-level output, y and y f , with 72.0% and 63.8% of their respective variance decomposition. A predominant role is observed for risk-premium shocks with 31.7% of aggregate output growth and 26.5% of firm-level output growth which reflects the large impact of these shocks during the financial crisis and the Great Recession (and their persistence on aggregate fluctuations, as discussed in the previous Subsection). Both monetary and fiscal/net exports shocks are also very influential on the fluctuations of US real GDP growth (22.7% and 17.2% of the variance decomposition, respectively) to underline the active role of the Fed and of the government on taking discretionary actions to either stimulate or stabilize the economy. Remarkably, the investment adjustment cost shock has a minor influence on the variability of aggregate and firm-level activity (0.4% and 0.3%). Technology shocks explain 12% of fluctuations in aggregate output growth and 6.7% on firm-level output growth. The price-push and, especially, the wage-push shocks do not have a significant impact on US aggregate fluctuations. It is particularly striking that wage-push shocks have so little influence on recent US business cycles (1.4% on aggregate output growth and 3.3% on firm-level output growth) as they were found quite influential over the Great Moderation period in conventional DSGE models (Smets and Wouters, 2007) .\\nThe shocks to the entry cost and to the liquidation value have a moderate impact on aggregate fluctuations. Thus, the shock on the entry cost explains 5.8% and 12% of variability of the quarterly growth rates of aggregate and firm-level output, respectively. Meanwhile, the liquidation value (exit) shock brings cyclical fluctuations that account for 7.2% of changes in output growth and 11.1% of changes in the firm-level output growth.\\nRegarding the extensive margin, supply-side shocks are predominant to explain 59.2% of the estimated variability in the rate of growth of the number of incumbents, n . There are three main contributors: technology shocks take 26.9% of business formation variability, entry costs take responsibility of 7.3% through its effect on business creation, and the liquidation shocks bring 20.3% of variability of establishments growth because of their effect on business destruction. Wagepush shocks account for 3.6% of business creation and price-push shocks only for 1.1%. On the demand side, both riskpremium and interest rate shocks have a relevant impact on business formation because they respectively 22.1% and 18.3% of the total variability of n . The role of investment and fiscal shocks is negligible with percentage values below 0.5%.\\nWhen comparing the determinants of fluctuations in the entry and exit rates, we find that demand-side shocks explain 65.4% of the variability in the entry rate, quite evenly distributed between the effects of risk-premium shocks and interest rate shocks. These shocks have a direct impact on the real interest rate and on the fluctuations of equity value because they have a large quantitative impact on the expected dividends, the expected aggregate demand and the discount factor. The exogenous driver of the entry rate (cost of entry shock) takes 17.9% of its variance decomposition. Technology shocks have also influence of entry rate variability with 12% while price-push and wage push shocks are less influential with just 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively.\\nAs for the exit rate variability, supply-side shocks mostly explain it (81.3%) as a combination of the effects from technology shocks (24.1%), price shocks (4.4%), wage shocks (7.3%) and liquidation shocks (45.4%). We could say that these four shocks are responsible for most of the fluctuations of the critical productivity which drives exit variability, and liquidation value shocks could be capturing the business destruction due to changes in regulation that favors bankruptcy filing. Demand-side shocks altogether take the remaining 18.7% of the overall variance of the exit rate, with a predominant role from risk-premium shocks (11.9%) to capture tighter financial conditions. In the estimated model with constant exit rate, the variance decomposition brings similar shares for the shock contributions (see the technical Appendix for the numbers). Demand-side shocks dominate on the variability of aggregate output growth while supply-side shocks explain a higher percentage of the fluctuations in the rate of establishment growth. The only noticeable difference with respect to the baseline model (apart from the lack of exit rate variability) is the higher influence of demand-side shocks for the variability of firm-level output growth.\\nThe empirical evidence provided in Section 2 indicates that the short-run fluctuations of the quarterly rates of TPE growth in the US have turned more volatile, more persistent and more correlated with real GDP growth after the financial crisis. Using counterfactual simulations within our baseline estimated model, we can discuss the sources of aggregate fluctuations during the Great Recession. 34 The size and sign of the shocks may be a key factor to explain the new patterns of US business cycle fluctuations. 35 There could also have been structural breaks on key parameters that govern price/wage rigidities, monetary policy, production technology or household preferences. 36 Unfortunately, data availabilty leaves short the number of observations of the subsamples of the Great Moderation and Great Recession (55 and 48 observations, respectively) and the quality of the estimation results would be questioned. In spite of that, we have run the subsamples estimation and reported the results in the technical Appendix. 37 Fig. 4 displays the quarterly contributions of a selection of shocks to the fluctuations of the rate of growth of US Total Private Establishments per capita, the rate of growth of the US real GDP per capita, the US establishment entry rate and the US establishment exit rate from 2007:1 to 2018:4. The criterion to decide the shocks to display has been to select those with the largest contribution to the variability of the corresponding endogenous variable. Table 6 provides the standard deviations of the contributions of the nine shocks. The four highest values from each variable determine the list of shocks on display in Fig. 4 . 38 As observed in Fig. 4 , technology shocks are crucial for the recovery of business activity (TPE) from 2009 to 2012 (as it can be foreseen when looking at the estimated series of the shock available in the technical Appendix). Actually, the contributions of technological innovations for TPE growth, real GDP growth and the entry rate swing dramatically from negative values at the early stages of the financial crisis to positive values in 2009. In addition, technology shocks have a major role on the reduction of the exit rate after 2009. Quarterly contributions of positive technology shocks range between 0.5% and 1% for both TPE growth and real GDP growth, and numbers remain on the positive side until 2012. It could be argued that the enormous business destruction that took place during the financial crisis of 2008 (more than 10 0,0 0 0 establishments closed in net terms) led to economy-wide technological innovations a few quarters later. This can be considered as a Schumpeterian interpretation (creative destruction) following the exit of the least productive firms, supported by the estimation results showing technology shocks help the business formation along the recovery path. 39 34 The analysis of this section is restricted to the baseline model with endogenous entry and exit as it has proved a better capacity to explain the US quarterly data on business creation and destruction. 35 As we document in the technical Appendix, the estimated series of the shocks of the model have some specific patterns during the Great Recession. In particular, technology shocks are more volatile and persistent, risk-premium shocks are more persistent, and fiscal shocks are less volatile and persistent. Remarkably, the quarterly series of risk-premium shock swings from the negative to the positive side in 2007, with high values (bordering the 1% value per quarter, 4% annualized) from 2008 to 2013. Technology shocks also play a significant role during the Great Recession as they turn strongly positive on the quarters that initiate the recovery path (2009) (2010) (2011) . 36 Hurtado (2014) estimates Smets and Wouters, 2007 model using a rolling-window approach. He shows that most parameters, including those that are considered structural, exhibit major shifts. This applies specifically to those related to Calvo price stickiness and the elasticity of labor supply. 37 In summary, we find that the Great Moderation had lower estimated values for the elasticity of the capital adjustment costs, ϕ k , and the capital share in the production technology, which explain the higher responsiveness of investment and physical capital (intensive margin) to absorb the effects of shocks. 38 See the technical Appendix for the complete shock decomposition with all the shocks of the model, and also for a display of the full sample period, 1993 to 2018. 39 There is empirical evidence consistent with our results: technology shocks grow after the financial crisis while the number of establishments fall. Following the Solow residual methodology of Fernald, 2014 , the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco publishes a times series of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in the US. This reports high rates of growth of US productivity in 2009 and 2010, with annualized rates of growth of TFP close to 4%. Moreover, The other main driver of recent US business fluctuations is risk premium shocks. Fig. 4 identifies risk-premium innovations as responsible for the severe contractions of both the number of establishments and real GDP in 2008 and 2009. Such negative contributions of risk-premium shocks averaging around 0.5% for TPE growth and 1% for real GDP growth between 2008 and 2009, consistent with the rapid increase in the cost of borrowing for the private sector (the deepest impact is a -2.27% cut in real GDP estimated for the last quarter of 2008). 40 It can also observed in Fig. 4 that the reduction in the number of establishments due to risk-premium shocks is simultaneously explained by a negative effect on the entry rate and the positive impact on the exit rate. The contributions of risk premium shock are very persistent: still contractionary until 2011 for real GDP growth (though its size and effect are diminishing over time) and even longer lasting for entry and exit which suffer negative contributions until 2014.\\nInterest rate shocks have two expansionary waves: in 2008-9 (financial crisis) and in 2014-15 (QE programs). In both cases, the expansionary actions of the Fed had positive effects on business formation. During the financial crisis, the Fed intervention to cut interest rates down to 0% provided some stimulus in 2008, with an average quarterly contribution of +0.36% to real GDP growth within that year and a peak effect of +0.70% in the first quarter of 2008. The impact on business growth is more moderate, with an average contribution of +0.18% in 2008. Between 2009 and 2011, the estimated contributions of monetary policy shocks are negative for both business formation and GDP growth, which reflects the severity of the the cross correlation between the quarterly rate of growth of US Total Factor Productivity Fernald, 2014 and the quarterly rate of growth of US Total Private Establishments (Bureau of Labor Statistics) between 2007:1 and 2011:4 is -0.47, consisted with the notion of Schumpeterian creative destruction. 40 The annualized spreads between Commercial and Industrial Loan Rates and the Federal Funds rate rose stadily from 1.72% in the first quarter of 2007:1 to 3.49% in the second quarter of 2010. Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank. economic recession and the impossibility of additional interest rate cuts due to the zero lower bound. 41 Later, the massive asset purchase program of the Fed (QE policies), give a second wave of monetary stimulus in 2013-2015. Interest-rate shocks may capture the role of unconventional monetary policy during the Great Recession as we have taken for the estimation the shadow interest rate series of Wu and Xia, 2016 . Expansionary QE policy actions can be observed as below-zero values in the shadow interest rate that bring negative estimates of the error term, ε R t , entering the monetary policy rule (20). In 2014, the year in which the Fed\\'s balance sheet reached its highest value (around 4 trillion dollars) the average quarterly effect monetary shocks on real GDP growth is +0.70% with a peak effect of +0.9% in the second quarter of 2014. 42 Fiscal policy turns influential for fluctuations of US real GDP growth in several punctual quarters. 43 In particular, there is a contractionary fiscal shock in 2011:1 that has a negative impact of -0.71% on real GDP growth. Other adverse fiscal shocks on GDP are displayed in Fig. 4 corresponding to the fiscal cliff turbulences occurred in 2012-2014.\\nAll the remaining sources of variability play a minor role (see Table 6 ). Investment shocks have little effects on fluctuations in business and GDP growth during the Great Recession. Price-push shocks and wage-push shocks also report small contributions. The entry cost shock shows countercyclical contributions for business formation although its quantitative impact is not large. Finally, the liquidation value shock affects business formation, with noticeable effects for reducing the exit rate and increasing the rate of growth of TPE between 2012 and 2018. Table 6 reports the mean and standard deviation of these sources of variability along the whole subsample 2007:1-2018:4. The sources of real GDP growth during the Great Recession are the technology shock (+0.096% per quarter) and, to a weaker extend, the interest rate shock (+0.036%), and the liquidation value shock (+0.076% per quarter). Meanwhile, the recession is mostly justified on the demand-side risk premium shocks with a negative effect of -0.266%. Fiscal shocks are quite volatile (with continuous short lasting ups and downs) because its standard deviation is almost as high as that of the interest rate shocks, even if the overall effect is quantitatively small.\\nBoth price-push and, especially, wage-push shocks play a minor role on output growth variability. The entry cost shock and the liquidation value shock have some impact on US growth variability, with similar standard deviations of their contributions and a higher positive value on liquidation (exit) shocks. The influence of these entry/exit shocks is more noticeable after the economic recession of 2008-09 as documented in Table 6 .\\nAs for business growth, Fig. 4 shows that technology shocks contribute even slightly more to business formation than to GDP growth, with an average impact of +0.116% per quarter. Financial and monetary shocks are very influential (although not as much as they are for real GDP growth) an average reduction per quarter of n due to risk premium shocks estimated at -0.236% and an average increase due to monetary shocks at +0.015%. The standard deviations of these contributions of financial and monetary innovations to business growth are both high, which indicates their major relevance for explaining fluctuations in net business creation in the Great Recession. Both the entry cost shocks (+0.018% per quarter) and exit liquidation shocks (+0.117% per quarter) have favorable effects, with a higher standard deviation on the latter to explain that exit variations play a more significant role than entry fluctuations.\\nWe have introduced a DSGE model with endogenous business creation (entry) and destruction (exit) to discuss the role of the extensive margin on US aggregate fluctuations. The Bayesian estimation of the model delivers fluctuations of the aggregate GDP explained by either changes at the extensive margin (number of firms) or at the intensive margin (firmlevel production). The model simulations provide a good matching to the second-moment statistics of the rate of growth of US private businesses, and also for those of the entry and exit rates. A variant of the model with a constant exit rate underestimates the procyclicality of business creation and gives a lower overall fit to US data.\\nIn the impulse-response functions analysis, we show that business formation is procyclical after technology and riskpremium shocks, which amplifies the effect of these shocks for aggregate fluctuations. In the variance decomposition analysis, the fluctuations of the rate of growth of aggregate US real GDP and firm-level output are mostly explained by demand-side shocks whereas supply-side shocks are the main drivers of the extensive margin (business formation), especially through exit dynamics. Moreover, shocks on the entry cost and liquidation value shocks explain together 13% of fluctuations of US real GDP growth and 27% of variability on the rate of growth of US private establishments. The evolution of the entry rate depends upon both demand and supply factors with a prevalence of risk-premium and monetary policy shocks, whereas the exit rate is mainly affected by supply factors such as shocks on technology and on firm liquidation value.\\nSince the empirical evidence shows an increasing role of business formation for US aggregate fluctuations over, we have examined the sources of these fluctuations during the Great Recession period that followed the financial crisis. Technology shocks were crucial for the start of the recovery with a significant influence to increase business entry, to reduce business exit, and to increase the rate of business growth. Risk-premium shocks had a dominant effect on the contraction of aggregate GDP and entrepreneurial activity during the financial crisis of 20 08 and 20 09, with long-lasting effects until 2014-15. Monetary policy shocks were expansionary both during the financial crisis and over the quarters of Federal Reserve\\'s quantitative easing program .', \"2009 will be remembered as the year of pandemic influenza, the first of its kind in over 40 years. However, an evaluation of the global response to the first wave of the pandemic is still ongoing. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the situation in China in order to gain a better understanding of the episode; to summarize the experiences in preparedness, control and mitigation of the pandemic; and to identify issues for further consideration and investigation in order to improve the response to possible next waves of the pandemic.\\nPandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, which originated in swine, was first detected in North America in Spring 2009. 1, 2 In June, its widespread transmission led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare pandemic influenza Phase 6 under the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism. 3 As of 6 August 2010, the global number of reported laboratoryconfirmed fatalities reached at least 18,449. 4 The actual fatality of the pandemic could be much higher, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 affected a disproportionate number of children and young adults. 5, 6 The possible impact of such a pandemic on the public health system, particularly on that of developing countries, was a large concern at the onset of the outbreak. This was especially true for China, a country with 1.3 billion people. With limited stockpiles of antiviral drugs, the absence of a vaccine in China, and little pre-existing immunity to the new virus in the aged population compared with those in Western countries, 7e9 the situation could have been devastating. Moreover, some Western provinces and many rural areas of the country have insufficient health facilities and therefore lack the optimal capacity to respond to the new virus.\\nOn the other hand, the response to the evolving pandemic was also an opportunity for China. The nation that experienced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 will never drop its guard against emerging infectious diseases. Since then, there has been substantial progress in the construction of a national public health system and hospitals for infectious diseases. 10 The web-based direct disease reporting system which allowed the Ministry of Health (MOH) to get information on public health emergencies directly from grassroots-level health professionals may be considered as a demonstration of an enhanced surveillance system. In addition, when the first human case of avian influenza was reported in 2005, 11 the influenza surveillance system was expanded to include 197 sentinel hospitals and 63 public health laboratories in all provinces. These efforts in recent years have laid an important foundation for the country to weather the current pandemic.\\nShortly after China learned about the H1N1 influenza outbreak in North America, the first step was to establish a command and control mechanism, the National Response Planning Committee (NRPC), with leadership at the highest levels (Table 1) . Under the direction of the State Council, the NRPC was led by the MOH, with the involvement of 33 different ministries. Eight task forces were formed to oversee all prevention and response strategies for the emerging pandemic. These types of intersectoral collaboration were also mirrored at provincial and local levels. Importantly, a special scientific advisory committee (SAC) was set up to provide technical support for evidence-based policy-making. In answering the call of the MOH, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) succeeded in establishing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic kits within 72 h of the genetic sequence being provided by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe second major step was containment. China's initial approach to the new virus differed from that of North America, as the Chinese Government sought to limit importation and to prevent influenza from spreading too quickly beyond the initial cases. In late April, H1N1 was categorized as a notifiable and quarantinable disease. Subsequently, controls and entry screening were tightened at national borders. The first confirmed case (a traveller from North America returning to Sichuan province) was reported on 11 May 2009. 12 All close contacts of that case on the same flight were immediately informed and put under medical observation for 7 days. The same approach was taken for other 'imported' cases, although this meant a huge amount of work at certain cost. All suspected cases were admitted to designated hospitals for respiratory isolation and laboratory confirmation.\\nAccording to Chinese law on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, cases and contacts of H1N1 were obliged to follow quarantine and medical measures. However, there were difficulties in persuading cases and close contacts to comply with the quarantine policy due to their lack of understanding of the rationale. This was overcome by communication and health education campaigns.\\nThe pandemic had a slow start in China. Between 30 April and 23 August 2009, more than 56 million individuals were scanned at border entries, 17,909 febrile patients were identified and 757 (4.2%) were subsequently confirmed. 13 Among the 9938 close contacts under medical observation, 551 (5.5%) were confirmed to have acquired the H1N1 infection. Such large-scale implementation of strong measures was supported by technological advances, including the distribution of PCR diagnostic kits to all public health and port-of-entry laboratory networks in early May. Beijing's experiences of these containment strategies were also shown to detect the H1N1 cases efficiently, with a considerable usage of resources. 14 The absence of large clusters until early June also suggests that the system succeeded in preventing sustained chains of transmission from the initial imported cases and in delaying the spread of the pandemic. The first 'local' cluster of 50 confirmed and 69 suspected cases without any clear links to international travel was reported in Guangdong province on 18 June, 38 days after the detection of the first 'imported' case. 15 A discussion was organized by the SAC on a possible adjustment of the control strategy. Given that the 'local' transmission was still quite limited and the schools in China would soon start the summer break, the SAC suggested that the containment strategy should be continued until July, which would significantly reduce the speed and scale of community outbreak. This suggestion was endorsed by the MOH and then at the level of the NRPC. To support this decision, the Ministry of Education decided to start the summer break at the beginning of July, approximately 10 days ahead of the usual schedule, and asked schools to cancel all unnecessary group activities during the summer holidays. This decision, together with the public health campaign at the community and public transport level, might allow China to experience 2 additional months of low pandemic activity. From May to August, a total number of 3779 cases were reported in China, and 885 were 'imported' cases ( Fig. 1 ). Mathematical modelling estimated that a reduction of 93% of new cases was achieved by the containment strategy during the first 90 days. 16 Thus, by delaying the inevitable acceleration of the pandemic until autumn, containment efforts were considered to win more time for other measures and preparations, such as improving the surveillance system, training health professionals for diagnosis and treatment of pandemic patients (especially in the low-income western provinces), and developing and licensing antiviral medicines and vaccines.\\nDirect financial expenditure of 5 billion Yuan (732 million US$ at 2009 exchange rates) by central government plus provincial funding were earmarked for the H1N1 response, including 660 million Yuan (96.6 million US$) for quarantine and early containment. 17 The huge financial and socio-economic (the negative impact on the domestic pork industry as well as tourism and international trade) costs of China's tough measures will have to be evaluated formally to see their cost-effectiveness. Additional factors, such as the summer heat and the fact that most schools were out of session at the time, need to be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of the actions.\\nIn early July, several clusters of H1N1 cases of significant size were reported in the south-east provinces, which have a high volume of international travel. As the virus continued to spread, the containment strategy became too resourceintensive and costly to maintain. Meanwhile, a large body of clinical data from China and abroad showed that most H1N1 cases were mild. The NRPC thus shifted its strategy from containment to mitigation, with an emphasis on reducing the pandemic impact. On 10 July, the Government removed H1N1 from its list of quarantinable diseases. Accordingly, on 30th September, the MOH decided on a major policy change in disease reporting: case-based surveillance of all H1N1 cases was replaced by sentinel surveillance of patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI), event-based surveillance of clusters of ILI, and case-based surveillance of laboratoryconfirmed hospitalized cases.\\nMore importantly, with the expansion of the sentinel surveillance system to 556 sentinel hospitals and 411 virology laboratories across the country, the number of people with ILI who sought treatment was closely monitored and provided an essential indicator of pandemic activity. As shown in Fig. 2 , viral transmission accelerated in the autumn, after the school term started in September and the National Day holidays in early October when many Chinese nationals travelled back to their hometowns. Also, there was a dramatic change with regard to the percentage of pandemic H1N1 strains isolated from ILI cases. Meanwhile, reports of school outbreaks gradually spread from the coastal cities to the rural areas and western provinces after October. Class or school closure measures were conducted in those schools with interrupted teaching activities due to large number of cases of H1N1 infection.\\nClinical treatment in the healthcare system, with enhanced surge capacity, is one of the most important responses to mitigate the pandemic's impact. In the containment phase, limited numbers of imported cases were detected. In the hope of slowing the spread of disease, all patients with confirmed infection e despite the fact that the majority had mild illness e were treated in the designated hospitals. 18, 19 Antivirals were distributed into the designated hospitals from the national and local stockpiles, and were used to treat the confirmed or clinically diagnosed H1N1 cases. Antivirals were also provided to high-risk close contacts, including pregnant women, persons with severe chronic medical conditions, children aged <5 years, elderly people aged 65 years, and healthcare workers. During the initial 2 months, 82.3% of confirmed H1N1 mild cases were administered oseltamivir (72.4% within 48 h of the onset of illness). 18 Since July, when the mitigation phase started, China focused on managing and treating patients with severe illness (Table 2) . Antiviral production and distribution were accelerated to prepare for the pandemic's peak. Patients were treated in designated hospitals to make optimal use of healthcare resources. Antivirals were recommended to those with severe or high-risk infections. 20 Other innovative treatments, such as Chinese traditional medicine and antiserum therapy, were also introduced. The use of Chinese traditional medicine treatment was recommended in the Chinese guidelines for the treatment of H1N1. In a prospective multicentre clinical trial leaded by Chen Wang and Bin Cao, the efficacy and safety of a Chinese traditional therapy, Maxing-shiganeYinqiaosan, in the treatment of H1N1 was evaluated in 2009. The results showed that the Chinese herb mixture reduced fever as well as oseltamivir in mild cases of H1N1. 21 In addition, the Chinese Government strengthened the treatment capacity of low-income provinces through additional investments in medical facilities and stockpiles.\\nWith extensive H1N1 infections, there was a sharp increase in the number of people presenting to the health services. Outpatient attendance peaked in OctobereNovember 2009, and the outpatient and emergency services of the healthcare system was overwhelmed, especially in many major cities in the northern provinces (Fig. 3 ). To cope with the increased demand for emergency and critical care services, the MOH mobilized surge capacity by training doctors in H1N1 treatment, increasing the number of designated hospitals and back-up hospitals, triaging and prioritizing services to manage the surge in case numbers, and establishing counterpart support mechanisms between provinces and hospitals. These responses optimized treatment with limited resources, and played a key role in decreasing the number of deaths caused by H1N1 infection.

The rapid development and deployment of the H1N1 vaccine represents a major achievement in China's response. However, the initial situation for China was far from satisfactory. Only one Chinese vaccine company, Sinovac in Beijing, China, acquired a licence to produce 'pre-pandemic' vaccine for H5N1 in 2008, 22 Before 1 October 2009, her 60th National Day, China became the first nation to begin mass-vaccinating highpriority groups. 26, 27 The timing was critical since national celebration ceremonies were planned. The vaccination campaign offered vaccines free of charge for all recipients and was voluntary. The campaign was first started among doctors, nurses, border staff and 200,000 performers taking part in the official celebrations. Subsequently, the campaign was extended to the priority population according to the MOH guideline for vaccination against pandemic H1N1. The priority group included healthcare workers, frontline public servants, schoolchildren and people with chronic diseases, particularly in the badly affected regions. When the vaccine became more abundant, the campaign was extended to any interested persons aged 3 years old. 27 On 11 December 2009 and 7 January 2010, the vaccination campaign was extended to pregnant women and children aged 6e35 months. Children aged 6e35 months were eligible for two doses of the vaccine, each with 7.5 mg of haemaglutinin. Vaccination was offered at the routine childhood immunization sites and also at the provisional sites for mass vaccination. All vaccine recipients or their guardians provided written informed consent and completed a brief medical history to identify persons at higher risk or with contraindications. 28 Pandemic vaccine production and inoculation may not only have prevented millions of people from getting H1N1 infection and protected those highrisk vaccinees from severe complications or death, but also contributed to social stability and prevention of public panic to a degree. In Beijing, 72% of schoolchildren, 60% of healthcare workers and other high-risk groups were immunized as of March 2010, and the high vaccine effectiveness of 87% in school-age children 28 showed that mass vaccination formed an immune barrier in the Beijing population and lessened school outbreaks.\\nThree information systems, arguably the largest worldwide, were established to support the campaign. They seek to monitor the vaccine supply and the condition of the vaccinees, especially those who reported adverse events following immunization (AEFI). By 14 April 2010, 151.5 million doses of vaccine had been released by SFDA, and 97.2 million people, representing 7.3% of the population, had been vaccinated against the H1N1 virus. 29 Through the AEFI surveillance system established for the H1N1 vaccination, the reported rate of suspected adverse events has been comparable to that of seasonal influenza. 27, 28 Given the health authorities' limited experience because of the low uptake rate of seasonal influenza vaccine (estimated at 2%), 30 this massive pandemic vaccination campaign, implemented in such a short time span, has proved to be highly successful. However, vaccination uptake was variable in different occupational groups. Cross-sectional surveys undertaken by the Chinese CDC showed that farmers had lower vaccination uptake compared with healthcare workers, students, teachers and office staff in urban areas. 31 Barriers to the uptake of the pandemic vaccine included concerns about the vaccine's side-effects and effectiveness in the general population and among healthcare workers, lack of knowledge about the national strategy, and scepticism of the necessity of vaccination, especially when the number of cases decreased during the later stages of the pandemic. 31,32\\nThroughout the pandemic, the Chinese health authority has regularly shared information through press conferences, press releases and regular updates on its official website. A hotline '12320' was introduced to respond to individual enquiries related to the pandemic. Health education campaigns touching on good hygiene practices and social distancing have been implemented in hospitals, schools, local communities and through mass media.\\nLooking beyond national borders, China has also strengthened international collaboration. Of note, the task force for international collaboration helped a lot in further strengthening the working relationship with WHO and the public health authorities and institutions in many countries. MOH communicates on the latest developments with WHO through the IHR and with the Mexican Ministry of Health, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. All these institutions have communicated important scientific information to China, which greatly facilitated research into, and implementation of, control measures of the pandemic.\\nChina has actively participated in H1N1-related international meetings and conferences, and has hosted training and provided PCR diagnostic kits for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries. On 20e21 August 2009, a scientific symposium was organized by MOH with the support of WHO and The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Chinese CDC took the opportunity to announce the safety and efficacy of the pandemic vaccine. 26 Result of the response and pandemic impact Strongly supported by the Government at all levels and the different circles of society, the Chinese public health and medical body made a great effort to fight against the first waves of pandemic. As of 21 March 2010, China had reported 127,533 laboratory-confirmed H1N1 cases, including 7511 severe or critical cases and 799 deaths (Fig. 4) . The focus group discussion conducted in five provinces in January 2010 also showed that clinical experts and epidemiologists at provincial and prefecture level believed that hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions associated with respiratory infection did not surge particularly in Winter 2009.\\nTo estimate the extent of infection, a nationwide serological survey was conducted in January 2010 in 11 provinces among 50,111 residents including those who had received prior pandemic vaccination. The results showed that, in the first wave, 207.7 million individuals (15.9%) experienced H1N1 infection from May 2009. 33 These serological data supported the conclusion that most of these cases were mild and did not approach healthcare facilities.\\nIn terms of social impact, the public did not show excessive concern about pandemic influenza. The H1N1-related '12320' hotline calls peaked in OctobereNovember 2009, coinciding with the peak in reported H1N1 cases, and a period of widespread community transmission in China (Fig. 5) . Public attention on this issue has declined to the baseline in January 2010. Internet Google searches on keywords related to pandemic influenza showed a similar trend. A web-based survey conducted by China Youth Daily in December 2009 showed that 85.2% of the 19,345 interviewees were satisfied with China's response to the pandemic. 34 Unlike SARS, when gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropped (from 10% in Quarter 1 2003 to 6.3% in Quarter 2 2003 when SARS was widely reported), the pandemic has had very limited impact on China's growth. Even with the international financial crisis, GDP grew by 9.2% in 2009, compared with 9.6% in 2008. 35 Similarly, there were around 126 million incoming \\nMore than a year has passed, but pandemic influenza remains a challenge for every country. China's response shows how a huge challenge can be transformed into an opportunity, and may offer some valuable lessons not only for China but also for the international community. First, the country was able to act quickly and decisively thanks to the strong command and control structure established right from the beginning. It put in place a multisector coordination mechanism, clear chains of command and division of responsibilities to ensure an integrated approach that covered all potentially affected areas while avoiding duplication. To cope with challenges in coordinating between the 33 different ministries and improving intercommunication, information was shared through periodic meetings, videoconferences, regular reports and using web-based information systems. It is recommended that a similar mechanism should be defined in the updated National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan.\\nSecond, science and technology played a key role in ensuring the effective control and mitigation of the pandemic and evidence-based decision making. The national influenza surveillance network was expanded and the laboratory testing of influenza and other respiratory viruses was strengthened. Rapid and cross-sectional serological investigations were also performed at different stages of the pandemic. These combined efforts provided a scientific basis for epidemiological evaluation, trend projection and adjustments in control and prevention measures. Third, advances were made in the treatment of cases through the use of traditional Chinese medicine and antiserum therapy. Vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities and people in rural areas were ensured access to medical relief and social security systems.\\nFourth, China was among the first countries in the world that developed, tested and issued a licence for the pandemic vaccine. This was made possible through active government participation, multisectoral support and coordination by the scientific research units. To solve the bottleneck problem of lacking availability of WHO reference standards and challenges in shortening each process of vaccine development and approval, a 'Research and Development, Production Coordination and Linkage Mechanism on Pandemic H1N1 Vaccine' was established by the authorities and vaccine manufacturers in early June. An alternative method for viral antigen quantification was developed by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control prior to the arrival of the WHO reference standards which enabled vaccine approval 1 month earlier, 23 and a fast-track for vaccine approval was opened by the SFDA. Free and voluntary immunization helped to protect those high-risk people, and to reduce social panic and potential disruption to the economy.\\nThe fifth lesson learnt is the importance of communication. Throughout the course of the pandemic, the MOH has provided the public with regular information on the latest developments and preventive measures. This has helped to prevent public panic and to promote personal protection against infection.\\nSixth, the pandemic was a showcase for international cooperation during public health emergencies. China has contributed by sharing information in a timely manner, providing technical support to developing countries, and convening global expertise on the pandemic.\\nIn addition, under the framework of IHR, China benefited greatly from information sharing, technique and viral strains exchange, and core capacity building, especially in pandemic preparedness from WHO and other member states.\\nFor all its achievements on the domestic and international front, there is still room for China to improve its pandemic response.\\nFirst, the national preparedness plan should be further developed to be more operational, not just for the current pandemic, but also for other potential public health emergencies. To this end, it would be useful to include scenarios based on the transmission ability of the pandemic, the virulence of the causing virus, and susceptibility among affected people.\\nSecond, epidemiological capacity including surveillance and research should be strengthened to conduct risk assessments and to inform decision making. A classification of the pandemic (or stages of a pandemic) based on risk assessment, geographical factors aside, would be useful for more rational mobilization and use of the limited human resources and supplies.\\nThird, more and timely public communications and health education are needed, such as the need for vaccination of high-risk groups, and the safety and effectiveness of the pandemic vaccine. In addition, coverage of the seasonal influenza vaccine should be enhanced to increase the public's immunity and to build the domestic industry's capacity to produce influenza vaccines. Also, the capacity of vaccine and antiviral distribution should be enhanced, especially for timely access to remote regions.\\nMore than 2 years after the start of pandemic H1N1, the world is fortunate that the impact has been moderate. China has emerged from this test with valuable experiences, and is well positioned to face another wave of the pandemic or other potential public health emergencies in the future.\", 'The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). As a result, schools across the United States canceled in-person classes and extracurricular activities such as interscholastic sports. Millions of youth who were typically physically active through sports were suddenly required to stay at home. The health of adolescent athletes has been reported to be negatively impacted by the cancelation of sport seasons during the pandemic (McGuine et al., 2020) .\\nThe health of adolescent athletes who participate in individual sports like cross-country may not have experienced the same negative experiences during COVID-19 as team sports athletes (McGuine et al., 2020) . That is because running can be performed outside of facilities and with the appropriate social distancing required during COVID-19. However, during spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic, youth long-distance runners reported a decrease in their running habits, including reduced running distance (decreased 14.0%), total number of runs per week (decreased 14.0%), and number of hard runs per week (decreased 27.0%) (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . This is in contrast with adult runners that reportedly increased their running behaviors following social distancing restrictions (DeJong et al., 2021; Holmes et al., 2021; Mosqueira-Ourens et al., 2021) . Adults who made more changes to their running behaviors were injured more but these changes were due to multiple factors (Holmes et al., 2021) . While changes in running habits have been described, motives to run may provide a greater depth of understanding why running habits increased or decreased during COVID-19 social distancing.\\nMotivation is important for maintaining physical activity and sport. Youth often choose to participate in sports based on social and competition motivational factors (Verkooijen et al., 2009) . Adult and youth long-distance runners have reported that socialization is a strong motive to run (Springer, 2013) . As socialization has been negatively impacted during COVID-19 worldwide (Ammar et al., 2020b) , it is reasonable to assume that socialization has been impacted in runners. This assumption was supported as adult runners who demonstrated a decline in motivation and transition from competition and socialization motives to fitness, occupying time, and stress relief motives (DeJong et al., 2021) . While less has been published in youth runners, competition may also be an important factor related to motivation and enjoyment in children (Chalkley et al., 2020) . As sports seasons and competitions were canceled due to COVID-19, youth runners may have become less motivated to run and felt less enjoyment, potentially contributing to the reported reductions in running (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . Understanding why youth long-distance runners change their running habits provides greater insights that could help coaches and health care professionals prepare youth runners return to running following a period of reduced running.\\nIn addition to reducing physical activity, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to worsening overall wellness across the globe. Sleep problems have been reported as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Voitsidis et al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021; Trabelsi et al., 2021) . During COVID-19 confinement, consumption of more unhealthy foods increased and more snacking occurred (Ammar et al., 2020a; Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020; Sanchez-Sanchez et al., 2020) . Elevated stress and anxiety levels have consistently been reported during COVID-19 social distancing and isolation (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2020b; Papandreou et al., 2020) . These findings of increased stress and anxiety have also been observed in youth athletes; however, most of these athletes participate in sports that cannot be competed in or practiced during social distancing (McGuine et al., 2020 (McGuine et al., , 2021 . Since many runners can continue their physical activity without access to facilities, they may be at a lower risk of worsening mental health during COVID-19 social distancing. Recently, Bazett-Jones et al. (2020) found that youth runners did not maintain physical activity and reported reduced running habits during COVID-19. Therefore, it appears that youth runners may not have benefitted as expected from the potential mental health effects of physical activity during COVID-19. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on the mental health and overall wellness of youth runners.\\nThe purpose of this study was to determine if the social distancing restrictions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic influenced running motivation, socialization, wellness and mental health in youth long-distance runners. We hypothesized that (1) self-reported motivation levels for running would decrease, (2) competition-related motives would be less motivating, (3) social distancing restrictions would result in decreased group running behaviors and increased running alone, (4) sleep quantity and quality would decrease, (5) quality of food intake would decrease, and (6) anxiety level would increase during COVID-19.\\nYouth long-distance runners were recruited from middle-and high-schools across the United States. Recruitment emails were sent to athletic directors or coaches asking them to provide the recruitment materials to the runners on their cross-county team as well as to encourage the runners to participate in the study. Participants from previous running research studies who qualified for this study were also recruited. Information about the study and survey links were sent between May and June 2020, with a reminder invitation sent 10-14 days after the initial invitation. The survey link was also shared on various social media platforms and others were encouraged to share the survey. Participants were included in the study if they were 9-19 years of age and participated in long-distance running activities including team/club cross-country, track and field (distances ≥800 m), road races, or recreational running. Participants were excluded if their primary sport was not cross-country or track and field and they did not participate in long-distance running activities and/or if they resided outside of the United States. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Toledo and Cincinnati Children\\'s Hospital Medical Center. Consent was obtained for participants 18 or 19 years of age and parental permission/child assent were obtained for participants 9-17 years old. Parents were encouraged to assist their child when necessary. The participants did not receive incentives for participating.\\nA customized, open online questionnaire was provided to the participants through password-protected instruments from Qualtrics (SAP SE, Germany) or Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, TN). The Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) was used to ensure study quality (Eysenbach, 2004) . Both instruments and institutions used identical questions. The questionnaire required ∼10 min to complete. It consisted of 83 items that were separated among a minimum of 13 screens. The questions inquired about the participant\\'s demographics (age, sex, state, years of running experience, recreational/competitive runner), running habits, runningrelated injuries (RRIs), running motivation, and wellness (sleep quality, anxiety, running enjoyment, food consumption quality) 6-months before as well as during social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020; DeJong et al., 2021) . Questions were presented in a consistent order with adaptive questioning dependent on participant responses. Participants were asked to complete the survey with no time restrictions. Participants had the opportunity to review and change their responses prior to submitting them. Once the submission was made, no changes to their responses were allowed.\\nRunning motivation questions included a 5-point Likert scale for how motivated the participant felt to run on a typical day (extremely motivated, somewhat motivated, no more/no less motivated, somewhat not motivated, extremely not motivated). Participants also ranked six motives (competition/races, socialization, enjoyment/pleasure, occupy free time, stress relief, exercise/fitness) for running from most motivating to least motivating. These motives categories have been used previously in research with adult runners during COVID-19 (DeJong et al., 2021) . While other questionnaires on running motivation exist [e.g., Motivation of Marathoners Scale (Zach et al., 2017) ], we agreed with other authors on its validity in a youth population (Malchrowicz-Mosko et al., 2020) who were non-marathoners. Runners were also asked about their most common running companion(s) [\"by myself, \" \"with my family member(s), \" \"with my friend(s), \" \"with my teammate(s), \" \"with my coach(es)\"].\\nSleep duration was self-reported in response to the question, \"how many hours of sleep per night were you sleeping?\" relative to either before or during social distancing restrictions. Children and adolescents have been reported to accurately report sleep duration compared to quantitative measures (Combs et al., 2019) . Sleep quality was self-reported using a 4-point Likert scale describing sleep quality (very bad, fairly bad, fairly good, very good) from the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989) . Similar Likert scales have been used previously to assess sleep quality in athletes (Andrade et al., 2016 (Andrade et al., , 2019 Brandt et al., 2017) . Participants were grouped as reporting good sleep quality (fairly good, very good) or poor sleep quality (fairly bad, very bad).\\nAnxiety of youth long-distance runners was measured using a 100-point visual analog scale (anchored as \"very anxious\" [0] to \"very calm\" [100]). Anxiety was defined as feelings of worry, nervousness, or unease about future events. Visual analog scales have been reported to be capable of validly measuring anxiety (Williams et al., 2010) .\\nEnjoyment of running was assessed with a visual analog scale (anchored by \"no enjoyment\" [0] to \"complete enjoyment\" [100]) from previous studies measuring running enjoyment in adult runners (Carnes et al., 2015 (Carnes et al., , 2016 .\\nYouth long-distance runners were asked, \"How would you describe the quality of foods that you ate regularly?\" relative to either before or during social distancing restrictions. Their selfperception of quality of foods that they regularly consume was measured with a visual analog scale (anchored by \"not healthy\"\\n[0] and \"healthy\" [100]).\\nIncomplete responses were excluded and completed surveys were used for analysis. The IP address was recorded for each response. If duplicate IP addresses were identified, the responses were checked for originality and responses from the same IP address were only used if the responses were clearly different (e.g., two siblings using the same home computer, or two teammates using a common school computer).\\nData analysis was conducted using SPSS statistical software (version 26, IBM Inc., Armonk, NY). Data were found nonnormally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p ≤ 0.05). Wilcoxon signed rank tests compared differences before and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions for motivation to run on a typical day, rank of running motives, sleep duration, anxiety, enjoyment of running, and quality of food consumed. Chi-square tests compared the proportions of participants who reported poor sleep quality and of running companions before and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. For the chi-square tests, adjusted standardized residuals were used for pairwise comparisons with significant differences occurring when z ≥ 1.96. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.\\nOf the 576 survey attempts, 287 participants (male = 124, female = 162, unspecified = 1; age = 15.3 ± 1.7 years; running experience = 5.0 ± 2.3 years) met inclusion criteria and were fully completed (completion rate = 49.8%). The most common reason for exclusion was due to being outside the required age range. In total, 235 (81.9%) and 52 (18.1%) participants reported they were competitive and recreational runners, respectively. Participants resided in 20 different states with most from the Midwest of the United States (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020). Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth longdistance runners reported lower overall motivation to run (p < 0.001) during COVID-19 social distance restrictions ( Table 1) . The motives for running were also significantly changed. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth long-distance runners reported increases in the average motive rankings of running to occupy free time (p < 0.001), relieve stress (p < 0.001), and for exercise/fitness benefits (p < 0.001) during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Running for competition (p < 0.001) and socialization (p < 0.001) were reported as having lower average motive rankings during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19. No difference was observed in the motive ranking of running for pleasure (p = 0.71) between pre-and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Pre-COVID-19, the most commonly reported greatest motive (ranked first) to run was competition (n = 151, 58.1%; Table 2), followed by exercise/fitness benefits (n = 51, 19.6%) and socialization (n = 31, 11.9%). Following COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, the most commonly reported greatest motive (ranked first) to run was exercise/fitness benefits (n = 107, 41.2%) followed by competition (n = 60, 23.1%) and to occupy free time (n = 33, 12.7%). During COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, a greater proportion of youth long-distance runners reported mostly running alone (pre-COVID-19 n = 36, 13.8%; during COVID-19 n = 171, 65.8%; z = 12.1; Table 3 ) and with family (pre-COVID-19 n = 8, 3.1%; during COVID-19 n = 41, 15.8%; z = 5.0) while a lesser proportion reported mostly running with teammates (pre-COVID-19 n = 196, 75.4%; during COVID-19 n = 24, 9.2%; z = −15.3). Similar proportions were noted observed for running with coaches (pre-COVID-19 n = 4, 1.5%; during COVID-19 n = 1, 0.4%; z = −1.3) and friends (pre-COVID-19 n = 16, 6.2%; post-COVID-19 n = 23, 8.8%; z = 1.2).\\nCompared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth longdistance runners reported less enjoyment running (p = 0.001), longer sleep duration (p < 0.001), more anxiety (p = 0.04), and lower food quality consumed (p < 0.001) during COVID-19 social distance restrictions ( Table 1) . A higher proportion of youth long-distance runners reported poor sleep quality during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions than pre-COVID-19 (pre-COVD-19 n = 44, 41.5%; during COVID-19 n = 62, 58.5%; p = 0.05) (Figure 1) .\\nThe purpose of this study was to determine if there were changes to running motivation, socialization, wellness and mental health in youth long-distance runners due to social distancing restrictions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We found that youth long-distance runners\\' motivation, motives, sleep duration and quality, quality of food consumed, running socialization, and anxiety were mostly negatively impacted by COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. These changes are consistent with other reported findings in youth athletes (McGuine et al., 2020 (McGuine et al., , 2021 and could have implications for the health and well-being of youth long-distance runners, which requires further investigation.\\nYouth long-distance runners\\' motivation and motives for running were different during COVID-19, likely due to the elimination of competitive seasons or events. Overall, selfreported motivation was significantly less during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (8.8% decrease). The top ranked motive, on average, for youth long distance runners pre-COVID-19 was competition but this motive fell to 5 th highest ranked motivator during COVID-19, which was a significant difference. Most youth runners ranked competition as their number one motivator pre-COVID-19 but this decreased to less than a quarter during COVID-19. Competition motivates youth to run (Chalkley et al., 2020) and removal of this competition motivator likely contributed to the decrease in running seen in this population during the pandemic (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . The only other motivator to decrease in its average ranking was socialization, moving from the 3 rd highest ranked motivator, on average, pre-COVID-19 to the lowest ranked motivator during COVID-19. Cancellation of these competitive seasons also impacted youth long-distance runner socialization in that practice with teammates was no longer possible, which is also a strong motivator in runners (Springer, 2013; Chalkley et al., 2020) . These results are consistent with changes in motivators in adult runners during the pandemic. DeJong et al. (2021) reported decreases in competition and socialization motivators in adult runners during COVID-19 than reported prior to COVID-19. The change in motivators for youth long-distance runners may also have influenced the significant decrease in self-reported enjoyment of running during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19. Due to the removal of competition and social interactions of the team, it may be that the youth long-distance runner in our study experienced less enjoyment due to the lack of these extrinsic motivators.\\nThe reduction in socialization as a motivator was also confirmed in our study as significant changes were noted in the proportions of running companions during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 restrictions, running took place with other people 86.2% of the time, but this fell to 34.2% during COVID-19. Cancellation of competitive seasons and team practices significantly reduced the opportunity for socialization with teammates. Almost five times as many runners ran alone during COVID-19 (n = 171/248) compared to pre-COVID-19 (n = 31/248) social distancing restrictions. This significant increase in running alone could be related to the lower enjoyment or motivation reported. Collegiate runners have reported greater enjoyment while running with others than alone (Carnes et al., 2015) . Enjoyment during sport participation is an important factor to maintaining involvement and reducing dropout (Gardner et al., 2017) . Maintaining enjoyment in this population during short-or long-term isolation (i.e., COVID-19, injury) is likely important to the youth long-distance runner. Similar isolation may be experienced in runners removed from competition due to injury. Strategies for maintaining socialization and enjoyment should be important topics of future investigations in this population. Parental involvement has been reported to positively influence enjoyment in youth tennis players (Hoyle and Leff, 1997) . While our findings indicated an increase of runners running with their family members, the percentage doing so was fairly low so we are not certain if it may have offset the reduction in enjoyment.\\nAs competition and socialization motivators and environments changed, running motivators of exercise, stress relief, and occupying free-time all increased in their average ranking during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. Interestingly, running as an activity to occupy free time was ranked last pre-COVID-19 (0% ranked as #1) but became the 2 nd highest ranked motivator during COVID-19 (12.7% ranked as #1). In adult runners, an increase in motivation to occupy free time has also been reported (DeJong et al., 2021) . In the same study (DeJong et al., 2021) , however, the adult runners did not show increases in other motivators. While youth long-distance runners reduced their running frequency and distance during COVID-19 (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) , the health benefits (exercise, stress relief) of running stayed as a strong motivator. Running for exercise was ranked #1 by almost 20% of participants\\' pre-COVID-19 and this increased to over 40% during COVID-19. These findings demonstrate that many youth long-distance runners are motivated to continue running despite the lack of competition and socialization. Further research on subgroups of those who are motivated by different factors should be undertaken to investigate their long-term impact on physical activity once competition is removed due to matriculation.\\nDeveloping and maintaining intrinsic motivators (i.e., exercise, stress relief) is important for youth athletes (Bergeron et al., 2015) for many different reasons, including maintaining mental health (Dore et al., 2016) . The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on mental health. During COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, increased anxiety (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) and decreased overall mental health (Liang et al., 2020) have been reported in the general adolescent and youth populations. Our findings are consistent with these studies (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) in that the youth longdistance runners reported a significant increase in anxiety during COVID-19 compared to their self-reported pre-COVID-19 levels. This elevation in anxiety could be related to a decrease in running in this population (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . Abruptly stopping running for as little as 2 weeks has been reported to cause an increase in depressive symptoms in regular runners (Morris et al., 1990) . This is important because multiple studies in adults have reported that adherence to physical activity guidelines has been shown to mitigate increases in anxiety during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions (Jacob et al., 2020; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2020a) . Further, it is unknown if there are long-term ramifications from the reduced mental wellness.\\nIn our study, youth long-distance runners reported positive and negative changes to their wellness habits. They reported an increase in sleep duration but a higher proportion reported poor sleep quality during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Increased sleep duration during COVID-19 confinement has been consistently reported in adolescents (Kaditis et al., 2021; Ramos Socarras et al., 2021) . However, long-distance runners have been reported to have inadequate sleep compared to recommendations (Garcia et al., 2021) . Increase in sleep duration is desirable because increased sleep duration improves attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health (Paruthi et al., 2016; Fox et al., 2020) . Symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression are more likely to be reported in adolescent athletes with poor sleep quality (Gomes et al., 2017; Potter et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, we are unable to discern if poor sleep quality is a result of increased anxiety or if increased anxiety is a result of poor sleep quality. It is unknown what long-term implications these changes may have, including how sleep quality and anxiety interact.\\nSelf-reported food quality significantly decreased during COVID-19 restrictions; however, this should be interpreted with caution do to the subjective, single-item nature of this question. Our limited results are in agreement with published literature demonstrating worsening food quality and poor nutritional habits in youth and adults during COVID-19 (Ammar et al., 2020a; Di Renzo et al., 2020; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2020b; Papandreou et al., 2020) . Consumption of unhealthy food, increased snacking, increased overall number of meals, and/or eating out of control may all contribute to a lower quality diet (Ammar et al., 2020a) . This worsening of consumed food quality could be attributed to reduced motivation, eating in response to boredom or anxiety or other mood-driven eating (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) . To our knowledge, the nutritional habits of youth longdistance runners has not been reported during COVID-19 and therefore, we are unable to understand the extent and meaningfulness of this reduction in self-reported food quality in our study sample.\\nSeveral limitations in this study are noteworthy. First, the cross-sectional nature of an online survey may have introduced some recall bias which influenced the reporting of some variables of interest. We attempted to minimize the impact of this by limiting the recall period to 6 months prior to COVID-19. Social distancing restrictions also differed in extent and timeline based on state government decisions, likely leading to variability in the stay-at-home orders affecting each participant. Second, our study was also limited in its measurement at one time point. Future research should study these variables in runners during the season following the COVID-19 restrictions to provide evidence of a long-lasting impact on youth longdistance runners. Third, though we attempted to get a broad sense of the COVID-19 impact on the runners, the responses were weighted more heavily among a few US states which may have introduced a geographic bias. Finally, the questions and/or scales used in this study have received limited investigation into their validity and reliability. The questions/scales may be missing or unable to measure important components of various concepts regarding motives, sleep, food quality, and anxiety. Further research is needed on these various topics in adolescents and long-distance runners.\\nWithin the context of these limitations, this study adds to the current literature regarding the negative effects that largescale cancellation of a sports had on youth long-distance runners during the COVID-19 pandemic (McGuine et al., 2020 (McGuine et al., , 2021 . Youth long-distance runners experienced changes in motivation, lower enjoyment of running, changes in wellness, and more anxiety even though they were not necessarily restricted in their ability to run, only the context and reasons for which they participated. However, running distance and frequency were reduced (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020), which may have been influenced by the removal of competition and social motivators. The use of technology to create competition or increase social interactions during times of increased isolation may be one solution to these barriers that warrants future investigation.\\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by University of Toledo Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants\\' legal guardian/next of kin.', 'Air pollution is a major environmental issue that affects people in developed and developing countries alike. Particulate matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO 2 ) , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOC\\'s) are the most common atmospheric air pollutants encountered in our daily life (Chen & Kan, 2008; Guo et al., 2019) . At the ground level, O 3 is a major secondary air pollutant and greenhouse gas, produced from its precursor gases in the presence of solar radiation, and it plays a crucial role in air quality (Yadav et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2020; Maji, Beig & Yadav, 2020; Resmi et al., 2020) . Particulate matters are complex mixture of organic and inorganic substances found in the ambient air, and they play a vital role in the radiation budget of the atmosphere via the scattering and absorption processes (Qu et al., 2017 (Qu et al., , 2018 . The major anthropogenic sources of PM 10 and PM 2.5 are vehicular emission, industry, building construction, quarrying and mining cement plants, ceramic industries and burning of fossil fuel power plants (Cheng et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2015) . Guo et al. (2017) revealed that, in India more than one million people died in 2015 due to particulate matter pollution.\\nCarbon monoxide is an important trace pollutant that influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, and the concentration of the surface O 3 by removing hydroxyl radicals, the primary oxidant in the troposphere (Duncan & Logan, 2008; Yadav et al., 2019a) . The main CO sources in the atmosphere are anthropogenic and natural (Lawrence & Lelieveld, 2010) . Inhalation of CO is considered very toxic to humans because it can cause acute intoxication (Kinoshita et al., 2020) . VOC\\'s emitted in the atmosphere consist of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and halogenated organic compounds (Liu et al., 2008; Montero-Montoya, Lopez-Vargas & Arellano-Aguilar, 2018) . These are emitted into the atmosphere by a number of industrial activities such as petrochemical process, storage, distribution, paint, solvent, combustion processes and motor vehicle exhaust (Franco et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2019b) . Isoprene and monoterpenes are another reactive natural VOC\\'s commonly found in the lower atmosphere, which are mainly emitted by biogenic sources like trees and plants (Fuentes et al., 2000; Menchaca-Torre, Mercado-Hernandez & Mendoza-Domínguez, 2015) . These hydrocarbons play a crucial role in the photochemical production of O 3 and other oxidants in the lower atmosphere (Atkinson, 2000; Srivastava, Sengupta & Dutta, 2005) .\\nSulfur dioxide is released into the atmosphere through both natural and anthropogenic emissions. Natural sources are mainly by volcanic eruptions while anthropogenic sources include the combustion of all sulfur containing fuels like oil coal and diesel used for the power generation for industrial activities (Mallik & Lal, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017) . Industrial and traffic emissions are the major ammonia (NH 3 ) sources in an urban environment (Pandolfi et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2013) .\\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV2) is the pathogenic agent of Covid-19, a disease first reported from Wuhan Hubei Province of China in December 2019. It was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 (Al-Qahtani, 2020). The course of the disease is often mild undistinguishable from severe pneumonia which eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death (Lu, Stratton & Tang, 2020) . India reported the first confirmed case of coronavirus infection on 30 January 2020 in the southern state of Kerala (Gautam & Hens, 2020) . To stop the spread of the virus pandemic, many countries have decided to enforce lockdown measures, even as they caused a severely downturn on the global economy. Subsequently, the Government of India imposed a countrywide lockdown to implement the Break-the-Chain mission to curtail its spread for 21 days in its first phase, and extended up to a second spell of 19 days and a final third phase of 14 days up to May 17 for a total of 54 days. As a result, tightened restrictive measures (i.e., closure all academic institutes, industries, markets, malls and all public places, non-essential businesses, limitation of motorized transports, shut down of Indian railway network, cancelation of inbound and outbound flights) were implemented throughout the nation to impose social distancing.\\nA substantial enhancement in the air quality in the lockdown period from all over the world were reported. Air pollution in China was significantly reduced as more people quarantined to prevent the social spread of Covid-19 (Dutheil, Baker & Navel, 2020; Muhammad, Long & Salman, 2020; Wang & Su, 2020) . Bao & Zhang (2020) reported that the concentrations of SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 and CO over 44 cities in northern China have decreased significantly by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67% and 4.58%, respectively due to vehicular restrictions during lockdown period. In addition to these, they conclude that these reduction in air pollutants caused a decrease in air quality index (AQI) by 7.80% over these cities in China. Likewise, Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) analysis carried out by Wang et al. (2020) found that, PM 2.5 concentration over different parts of urban areas in China were significantly reduced in lockdown period. The findings of Shi & Brasseur (2020) showed that particulate matter pollution decreased by an average of 35 percent and nitrogen dioxide decreased by an average of 60 percent in northern China after the lockdowns began on January 23. However, the study found the average surface O 3 concentration increased by a factor of 1.5-2 over the same time period. Bauwens et al. (2020) also observed a substantial decrease of NO 2 column by 40% over cities in China and 20-38% in Western Europe and USA. Kanniah et al. (2020) reported that PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 and CO concentrations were reduced to 26-31%, 23-32%, 63-64%, 9-20% and 25-31%, respectively in urban regions of Malaysia during the lockdown period. Further, they revealed that the restricted industrial activities imposed in lockdown period resulted a reduced concentrations of Aerosol Optical Depth and tropospheric NO 2 over East Asian region. There were reports that air pollution was significantly reduced in Barcelona in Spain (Tobías et al., 2020) and European region (Sicard et al., 2020) due to the lockdown to prevent Covid-19 spread. A decline in NO 2, NO and an increase in surface O 3 was observed at Sao Paulo in Brazil during lockdown period (Dantas et al., 2020; Nakada & Urban, 2020) . Air pollution levels have dropped significantly in India due to a massive dip in vehicular movement and industrial activity which have resulted in clean and fresh air (Gautam, 2020; Mahato, Pal & Ghosh, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020) .\\nIn the meantime, Kerala state government imposed a \"triple-lockdown\" in Kannur from 20 April for 20 days after identifying Kannur as a \"hotspot\" of Covid-19 and declared it a \"red\" zone in the state. The \"triple-lockdown\" involved a combination of technology and human surveillance and movement restrictions ple by providing one entry and exit point in all abodes leaving all other roads closed for traffic. People in red zones were not allowed to leave their houses and essential items were made available local authorities through specific requests. Further, guards were deployed to ensure that people in the containment zones stayed indoors during the entire period of the lockdown. During the general lockdown and triple-lockdown periods, the skies over the polluted cities quickly cleared and smelled of fresh air. This offered a rare occasion for investigating how the air pollution levels responded to an extraordinary development.\\nIn this work, we describe the trend in air pollution via monitoring the variations of surface O 3 , NO and NO 2 , PM 10 and PM 2.5 , CO, VOC\\'s including benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, o-xylene (collectively called BTEX), SO 2 , NH 3 , and meteorological parameters at the time of pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days at Kannur town in the Kerala state of South India.\\nKannur was the British military headquarters on the west coast of India until 1987. Kannur has had its industrial importance from very early days. It was an important trading center of the 12th century with an active business relationship with European and Arab countries. When the state of Kerala was formed in 1957, it was named Kannur town, because administrative offices were established in the district. Kannur is the sixth-most urbanized district in Kerala, with more than 50% of its residents living in urban areas. The district is known for its high level of literacy and health care. Kannur experiences a summer season from March to the end of May. This is followed by the south-west monsoon until September. Even the smallest pollution in the atmosphere of Kannur affects the quality of the air and subsequently the health of the people here. In the first phase of Covid-19, Kannur district reported the highest number of cases in Kerala till 15 May. Ground based observations were carried out at Kannur town to investigate the variations of different trace pollutants in the atmosphere from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The observational site lies in a coastal belt along the Arabian Sea and is very close to the National Highway (NH 17). Observational site at Kannur town (11.87 N 75.37 E 3 m msl) in northern part of Kerala state. Kannur in south India is shown in the Fig \\nObservations of trace pollutants were carried out using the respective ground based gas analyzers from Environment S.A France. The measurements of the O 3 were made using a continuous O 3 analyzer (Model O342e) with a detection limit of 0.2.ppbv. Its working principle is based on O 3 detection by direct absorption in UV light. O 3 absorption spectrum is intense in the 250 and 270 nm wavelength range. Thus, it corresponds to the maximum range of O 3 absorption at 255 nm. NO, NO 2 and NH 3 were measured with the aid of gas analyzer (Model AC32e) with a detection limit of 0.2 ppbv. Its working principle is based on the NO chemiluminescence in the presence of highly oxidizing O 3 molecules. The NO in the ambient air is oxidized by O 3 to form excited NO 2 molecules. The concentrations of NO, NO 2 were measured based on the spectrum of the radiation emitted by NO 2 molecules at the excited level. Particulate matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) were measured by using suspended particulate beta gauge monitor (Model MP101M). Its working principle is based on the particle measurement by beta radiation attenuation. The measurement consists of calculating the absorption difference between a blank filter and a loaded filter, knowing that the beta ray absorption follows an exponential law and is independent of the physiochemical nature of the particles.\\nMeasurements of CO were made by using an analyzer (Model CO12e) with a detection limit of 0.05 ppm. Its working principle is based on CO detection by absorption in infrared light. VOC\\'s (BTEX) were measured, based on gas chromatography coupled with a PID detector by using (VOC72e) analyzer. SO 2 measurements were made by using a UV fluorescent sulfur dioxide analyzer (Model AF22e) with a detection limit of 0.4 ppbv. The ambient air to be analyzed is filtered by a hydrocarbon removing aromatic molecule device. The hydrocarbon molecule free sample to be analyzed is sent to a reaction chamber, to be irradiated by an UV radiation centered at 214 nm, which is the SO 2 molecule absorption wavelength. All the gas analyzers have been calibrated by using sample gases on a regular basis. The total solar radiation was measured by LSI LASTEM Italia (DPA870) pyranometer and surface air temperature measured by an external Pt100 sensor.\\nThe AQI is a scale designed to help us to understand the quality of the air we breathe and it also helps provide advice on how to improve air quality. Further, this index provides special awareness to the public who are sensitive to air pollution (Beig, Ghude & Deshpande, 2010) . Normally air pollution levels may be higher in towns, near power plants and large stationary emission sources. To identify the overall improvement in air quality over Kannur, AQI was calculated and the details of AQI are available elsewhere severe (401-500) respectively. The observed concentrations of PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , CO and NH 3 were converted into AQI using standard value. The AQI for each pollutant was calculated by the following formula given by Sahu & Kota (2017) .\\nWhere C i is the observed concentration of the pollutant \"i\"; Break HI and Break LO are breakpoint concentrations greater and smaller to C i ; and I HI and I LO are corresponding AQI ranges. Breakpoint concentration of different pollutants are provided by CPCB (2014) and is shown in Table 1 .\\nIn order to study the impact of lockdown on the variation of trace pollutants over Kannur, the study period was divided into three spans; namely pre-lockdown period of 32 days (1-24 March 2020 and 10-17 May 2020), lockdown period of 25 days (25 March-19 April 2020), and a triple-lockdown period of 20 days (20 April-9 May 2020). O 3 concentration at Kannur town was very low (8-20 ppbv) at night time and high (15-55 ppbv) during the day time. Figure 2A depict a diurnal variation of O 3 in Kannur town, and it shows that O 3 was observed to be high during afternoon hours due to the photolysis NO 2 in the presence of VOC\\'s, CO and CH 4 . The observed low concentration at night-time was mainly due to the loss of O 3 by the titration with NO (Nishanth et al., 2014) . Diurnal variation of O 3 showed a similar pattern in pre-lockdown days, lockdown days, and triple-lockdown days but with differences in their concentrations. The maximum concentration of O 3 observed on pre-lockdown 4.74 (ppbv), lockdown days and triple-lockdown days were (45.64 ± 4.74 days), (49.58 ± 3.1 ppbv) and (55.66 ± 2.61 ppbv) respectively. Thus, an enhancement in O 3 concentration was observed over Kannur from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown and this increase is 22%.\\nThe diurnal variations of NO and NO 2 are shown in the Figs. 2B and 2C respectively. NO concentration was observed high in night and early morning hours and found to be low during afternoon hours. The diurnal average concentrations of NO observed during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days were (5.4 ± 1.2 ppbv), (3.5 ± 1.1 ppbv) and (2.1 ± 0.82 ppbv) respectively. Thus, the concentration of NO was found to be declined considerably from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days, and the decrease was 61%. The domination of O 3 titration in the presence of high concentration of NO is the primary reason for the observed low concentration of O 3 during pre-lockdown days.\\nIn pre-lockdown days, NO 2 concentration was found to increase in daytime due to enhanced emissions from vehicles and industries. The diurnal average concentrations of NO 2 observed during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days were (9.6 ± 2.1 ppbv), (4.9 ± 1.8 ppbv), and (2.8 ± 0.88 ppbv) respectively. Hence, the concentration of NO 2 was found to be decreased significantly from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days and the observed decrease was 71%. Conversely, O 3 concentrations observed were higher on triple-lockdown and lockdown period than pre-lockdown period, even in the absence of industrial activities and low traffic. Certainly, relatively lesser release of NO during lockdown and triple-lockdown days reduces the O 3 scavenging, and hence improved the photochemical production of O 3 from its other precursors.\\nAt city-scale, VOC-NOx ratio is the key factor of O 3 formation (Pusede & Cohen, 2012). The urban areas are characterized by a low value of this ratio due to high NOx concentrations (Beekmann & Vautard, 2010) . In an environment with \"VOC-limited\" conditions, VOCs concentration is highly sensitive in O 3 formation in an environment with high NOx emission. Likewise, the ratio of (NO 2 )/(NO) that depends on the local concentration of O 3 , since it is produced by the photodissociation of NO 2 and its sink is titration with NO. Thus, O 3 increase is due to a lower titration of O 3 by NO due to the strong reduction in local NOx emissions by road transport (Sicard et al., 2020) . However, the presence of VOC\\'s and NOx allows the formation of O 3 through NO 2 photolysis through a complex chemistry (Monks et al., 2015) . The day time average concentrations of (NO 2 /NO) during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days were estimated to be (1.82 ± 0.8 ppbv), (1.38 ± 0.6 ppbv) and (0.86 ± 0.5 ppbv) which indicated a reduction of (NO 2 /NO) by 47% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The ratio between average concentrations of BTEX and NOx were found to be (1.2 ± 1.6 ppbv), (1.65 ± 1.1 ppbv) and (1.96 ± 0.82 ppbv) during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days respectively; with an increase of 63% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown. During the lockdown period, O 3 lapse rate due to the titration of NO might be less than its photochemical production from its precursors, and this may be the primary reason for the enhancement in O 3 observed. Further, a strong possibility of VOCs emission from home (e.g., cleaning fireplaces, painting) and garden activities (e.g., biomass burning) may also have contributed to the O 3 increase (Su, Mukherjee & Batterman, 2003; Murphy et al., 2007; Wolff, Kahlbaum & Heuss, 2013) in triple-lockdown days. Thus, the reduced concentration in NOx, and any enhancement of biogenic VOC\\'s and their transport may have played a promising role in the enhancement of O 3 during triple-lockdown in Kannur town like other cities, which could be confirmed only after further investigations.\\nDiurnal variation of photo-dissociation rate coefficient j(NO 2 ) was computed to estimate the strong dependance of NO 2 on the observed enhancement of O 3, during lockdown and triple-lockdown days as shown in Fig. 2D . The j(NO 2 ) values exhibited the typical pattern of increasing gradually after sunrise, attaining a maximum value during noontime and decreasing during evening-time. The values of j(NO 2 ) gradually increasing in tune with the intensity of solar radiation reaching on the surface. During pre-lockdown days, O 3 concentration was increasing in full harmony with the variation of j(NO 2 ). Therefore, a positive correlation is observed between O 3 and j(NO 2 ) during day time hours and the photo-dissociation coefficients were low due to the reduced concentration of NO 2 in lockdown and triple-lockdown periods. It was further observed that j(NO 2 ) values were decreased in pre-lockdown days and triple-lockdown days by a percentage of 16%. This reveals that the O 3 production was the result of photo-dissociation of NO 2 in the presence of biogenic VOCs during lockdown and triple-lockdown days.\\nThe diurnal variations PM 10 and PM 2.5 during the study period are shown in the Figs. 3A and 3B. During pre-lockdown days PM 10 and PM 2.5 showed two peaks; of which one peak in the morning (07:00-10:00) hours and the other one in the late evening to night time (19:00-22:00) hours. Further, moderate levels were observed from night till the early morning hours due to shallow boundary layer (Yadav et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2018) .\\nConcentrations of particulate matters showed a morning peak followed by a decline in the afternoon on pre-lockdown days. The observed low concentrations of particulate matters during the afternoon hours can be attributed primarily to the dilution of particles linked with broaden boundary layer and also lesser traffic (Stafoggia et al., 2019) .\\nIn the lockdown days, the vehicular emissions were considerably reduced, and the observed magnitude of the morning peak was fairly small; whereas in triple-lockdown days the peak was absent due to the roads were deserted. The diurnal average concentration of PM 10 observed on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days and triple-lockdown days were (127.8 ± 21 µg/m 3 ), (70.96 ± 12.6 µg/m 3 ) and (50.2 ± 10.11 µg/m 3 ) respectively. The concentration of PM 10 was found to decrease significantly from pre-lockdown days to lockdown days (45%) and lockdown days to triple-lockdown days (29%). Likewise, the diurnal average concentration of PM 2.5 on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days and triple-lockdown days were (69.4 ± 17 µg/m 3 ), (45.5 ± 8 µg/m 3 ) and (32.5 ± 7.5 µg/m 3 ) respectively. The concentration of PM 2.5 was found to be decrease extensively from pre-lockdown days to lockdown days (34%) and lockdown days to triple-lockdown days (29%).\\nLinear negative correlations are obtained between PM 10 and solar radiation (Fig. 3C ) and surface O 3 (Fig. 3D) . The higher concentration of particulate matters on pre-lockdown days can reduce the photolysis rate j(NO 2 ) in the lower troposphere and it can decrease photochemical production of O 3 on these days. During pre-lockdown days, the observed low Diurnal variation of solar radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity observed over Kannur during the study period is shown in the Figs. 4A-4C respectively. Intensity of solar radiation and temperature were increase by 7% and 4% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days and relative humidity decreased by 8%. The increase in solar flux is attributed to the decline in the concentration of particulate matters (Li et al., 2011) in lockdown and triple-lockdown days, and this enhanced atmospheric temperature and declined relative humidity at this site.\\nDiurnal variation of CO, BTEX, SO 2 and NH 3\\nDiurnal variation of CO, BTEX, SO 2 and NH 3 observed during the observational period are shown in the Figs. 5A-5D respectively. In pre-lockdown days, the diurnal variation of CO, BTEX and SO 2 shows two distinct peaks; one peak during morning (08:00-11:00) hours and other at late evening. The small duration of the morning peak was due to the expansion of boundary layer height whereas the large evening peak due to the shallow boundary layer. These peaks were associated with high traffic during the morning and evening hours. During lockdown days, a small peak observed in the morning was due to the presence of few vehicles; while the peak was absent in triple-lockdown days due to the roads were deserted. The maximum concentration of CO observed in day time on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days, and triple-lockdown days were (642 ± 115 ppbv), (368 ± 79 ppbv) and (210 ± 70 ppbv) respectively. The concentration of CO was found to decrease significantly from pre-lockdown days to lockdown days, and lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The maximum concentration of BTEX observed in day time on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days and triple-lockdown days were (9.5 ± 1.4 ppbv), (6.7 ± 1.1 ppbv) and (3.7 ± 0.8 ppbv) respectively. The concentration of BTEX was found to be decreased from pre-lockdown days to lockdown days, and lockdown days to triple-lockdown days due to absence of vehicular and industrial emissions. The diurnal variation of SO 2 was most pronounced during traffic hours over Kannur town. The maximum concentration of SO 2 observed in day time on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days, and triple-lockdown days were (2.86 ± 0.72 ppbv), (1.82 ± 0.45 ppbv) and (1.08 ± 0.32 ppbv) respectively. Thus the concentration of SO 2 was found to be decrease considerably from pre-lockdown days to lockdown days, and lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. During pre-lockdown period, the daily averaged NH 3 concentrations varied from 5.1 to 5.8 ppbv. Daily NH 3 exhibited a temporal variation with higher concentrations on the noon time hours; due to higher air temperatures and lower wind speeds. High air temperatures will favor NH 3 volatilization, and the low wind speeds support the accumulation of air pollutants (Wang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016) . The maximum concentration of NH 3 observed in day time on pre-lockdown days, lockdown days, and triple-lockdown days were (5.84 ± 0.52 ppbv), (5.32 ± 0.41 ppbv) and (4.91 ± 0.32 ppbv) respectively. Like other trace pollutants, the concentration of NH 3 was also found to be decreased from pre-lockdown period to triple-lockdown days due to complete shutdown of traffic and industrial activities in Kannur district.\\nThe overall AQI of a day is the maximum AQI of the constituent pollutant, and the corresponding pollutant is the dominating pollutant. Figure 6 represents the variation of AQI during the study period over Kannur town. The highest index of 235 ± 32 which refers to poor air quality was observed in pre-lockdown period from 1 to 5 in March, during which the vehicular traffic was quite normal. From the figure, it is observed that the AQI was declining from 25th March coincides with the beginning of lockdown. In the first 5 days of the lockdown its average value was changed to 128 ± 22 and then to 118 ± 20 in the following days. Since the triple-lockdown in Kannur was implemented on 20th April, the value of AQI further come down and reached its lowest level at 48 ± 10 due to the ban of complete vehicles on the road. As a result, air pollution was highly reduced by which the air became unpolluted at this site. Thus, the enhanced air quality resulted from the triple-lockdown may prevent the virus spread in Kannur district.\\nThe present study revealed a drastic reduction in air pollution over Kannur a town in north of Kerala state India, which was identified as one of the \"first hotspots\" of COVID 19 by the Government of India. Subsequently, a triple-lockdown was implemented from 20 April for further twenty days that restricted the movement of people. A considerable reduction in atmospheric air pollutants over this region was observed during the lockdown and triple-lockdown periods at this site. The highlights of the observation are the following:\\nSurface O 3 concentration was increased to 22% in triple-lockdown period while NO and NO 2 concentrations were decreased to 61% and 71% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The primary reason for the increase in O 3 is due to the reduction in titration of O 3 with NO. The sensitivity of VOC\\'s (both biogenic and industrial) could be confirmed by measuring them on a long-term basis. The calculated diurnal profile of j(NO 2 ) values showed a maximum reduction in triple-lockdown period due to the decrease in NO 2 . The concentration of CO, VOC\\'s (BTEX), SO 2 and NH 3 were declined to 67%, 61%, 62% and 16% respectively from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 were decreased to 61% and 53% respectively. Further, the increase in solar flux observed was mainly due to the absence of scattering and absorption of aerosols present in the atmosphere due to lockdown. The AQI analysis revealed that the air quality in Kannur was quite improved during lockdown period.\\nThe dramatic decline in air pollution during this lockdown has significant immediate consequences. Exposure to high levels of particulate matters and trace gases has substantial detrimental effects on human health. Many researchers have hypothesized that the drop in air pollution levels may currently be saving a significant amount of lives, not only by reducing individuals\\' susceptibility to COVID-19, but also by preventing world\\'s seven million annual deaths due to air pollution exposure.\\nYao et al. (2020) analyzed the death rate due to COVID-19 and spatial correlation of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in China, and they revealed that higher concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 had a positive correlation with deaths caused by COVID-19. Wu et al. (2020) suggested that, long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) induced a risk of COVID-19. Further, they found that an increase of 1 mg/m 3 in PM 2.5 enhanced 8% morbidity due to COVID-19 in the United States. Fattorini & Regoli (2020) suggested that, chronic exposure of particulate matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) could aggravate the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection. A positive correlation exhibited between concentrations of PM 10 , PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO and COVID-19 outbreak in California (Bashir et al., 2020) . It is reported, that air pollution has a positive association with COVID-19 confirmed cases in China (Zhu et al., 2020) . Thus, this improvement in air quality during lock down might have played a vital role in bringing reduced susceptibility of virus getting infected into the lungs. The enhancement in the air quality induced by triple-lockdown might be one of the prime reasons by which Kerala could flatten the transmission curve for the first time in India. This association of air quality and spread of COVID if confirmed by future studies suggest that air quality should also be considered as part of an integrated approach towards human health protection and prevention of the epidemic spreads.', 'A population can be immune to epidemics even if not all of its individual members are immune to the disease, just as long as sufficiently many are immune-this is the traditional notion of herd immunity. In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease-a notion we propose to call \"digital herd immunity\", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel \"contact tracing\" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study in the first place and whose case we discuss briefly.\\nRecent events have challenged the public health infrastructure worldwide for controlling the spread of contagious diseases. This difficulty is partly due to the novel pathogen involved and partly due to some unusual characteristics of COVID-19 [1] , which pose unique obstacles to developing a systematic public health response. Specifically, the infection appears to be transmitted through a large number of asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and the fraction of such transmission is large enough to lead to an epidemic on its own, even if all symptomatic cases were immediately isolated [1, 2] . This leaves two approaches to controlling an exponential growth in the number of infected people. The first is continuous monitoring of entire populations via regular testing, which can identify new infections already during their latent phase and thus end non-symptomatic transmission. The second is the established method of \"contact tracing\" [3] , in which people who have been exposed to newly identified infected people are isolated before they have a chance to infect others. In principle, either approach is capable of ending the epidemic.\\nPopulation-level testing is not possible today, but perhaps with major advances in pooled testing this may be possible not too long from now, at least for populations in countries with the requisite health care infrastructure. Traditional contact tracing, done by teams of health officials relying on interviews with newly identified cases, is also not up to the task today, as it fails if non-symptomatic transmission is too frequent [3, 4] . Fortunately, we live in the smartphone era, and it has been noted that using these devices to record contacts can make the task of tracing them entirely solvable by automating it. This idea has been spelled out in a series of papers [5, 6] and is the basis for a rapidly expanding set of contact-tracing apps and the recent announcement by the Apple-Google duopoly of their intention to build the technology into their operating systems [7] . We note that the possibility of using mobile networks to study disease dynamics has been explored in the past [8] [9] [10] .\\nIn this paper we contribute to this emerging field of infectious disease control along two axes. First, we present a simple model of the early stages of the spread of COVID-19, which allows us to obtain estimates, as a function of a varying amount of non-symptomatic transmission, of the fraction of the population that needs to participate in a digital contact sharing network in order to prevent new epidemics. Our interest in this question was seeded by the very practical question of whether a country like India can use this technology to achieve epidemic control today. Indeed, India is now launched on this enterprise [11] . While somewhat more complex modeling with various differences from our own became available while we were working on this problem [5, 12] , we feel that our approach has the virtue of making the existence and values of the estimated compliance thresholds transparent. Our estimates for the fraction of the population that needs to own a contact-tracing app to avert a COVID-19 epidemic range from 75% − 95%, depending on the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, θ = 20% − 50%, that takes place. Busy epidemiologists and health officials will find this part of interest.\\nOur second contribution is to frame the overall discussion in a language more familiar to physicists and students of complex phenomena more generally-that of phases, phase transitions and emergent properties. The bottom line here is the idea that the immunity of a population to epidemic growth is an emergent, or collective, property of the population. For traditional vaccination or epidemic-induced \"herd immunity\", this feature gets conflated with the fact that individuals can be immune to the disease at issue. But mass digital contact tracing now makes it possible for the population to be immune to epidemic growth even as no individual has immunity to the underlying disease. We propose to refer to this as the existence of a \"digital herd immunity\". This fits well into the general idea of an emergent property, which does not exist at the level of the microscopic constituents but exists for the collective [13, 14] . We would be remiss if we did not note that epidemiologists have previously referred to this state of affairs as \"herd protection\" and \"sustained epidemic control\" [5] . Our intention with the proposed terminology is both to frame a public health goal by including the word digital and to emphasize the emergent nature of a herd immunity.\\nIn the balance of this paper we do the following. We begin by summarizing the case for contact tracing as an effective strategy for combating COVID-19. We then introduce a simple branching-process model for the spread of this disease, that incorporates the key features necessary to assess the efficacy of a digital, app-based approach, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission and recursive contact tracing. We find in general that there is a critical fraction 0 ≤ φ c < 1 of app ownership, such that takeup of contact-tracing apps by a fraction φ > φ c of the population is sufficient to prevent epidemic spread. We provide an analytical, \"self-consistent mean-field\" estimate for this threshold, which is verified against detailed numerical simulations. In the final discussion, we address the applicability of our results to the specific context of India.\\nA. Motivation and relevance to COVID-19\\nTraditional contact tracing is a multi-stage process. First, one identifies symptomatic, infected individuals. Next, one finds the people they came into close contact with during their infectious period. Finally, one treats or isolates these people before they can go on to infect others. Manual contact tracing becomes difficult for infections that have a period before the onset of symptoms when an exposed person is contagious (the Ω period). Further delay in finding the symptomatic person and their contacts could lead to tertiary infections, making it difficult to control an outbreak. For COVID-19, the incubation period is thought to be around 5-6 days, while the Ω period is estimated to be 1-3 days [2] . The time before becoming contagious, or the latent period L, is around 4 days. Stochasticity of these times aside, it is reasonable to expect that if Ω < L on average, and if the exposed contacts of an individual can be traced before they become infectious, then an epidemic could be prevented. However, the delays typical for manual contact tracing, even just one or two days, can render contact tracing completely ineffective for COVID-19, given the typical L and Ω periods; this conclusion is supported by detailed numerical simulations [5, 12] . This is where digital contact tracing comes in. A smartphone application could enable instant isolation of an infected person and their network of contacts. This halts the transmission chain, because infected contacts cannot infect others during their latent period. The question immediately arises of how widespread such tracing needs to be in order to prevent an epidemic, and this question is the focus of our paper. Below we present a simple model that captures the essential features of disease spread necessary to tackle this problem.\\nTo place our work in context, the classic quantitative analyses of the efficacy of contact tracing [3, 4] , from before the smartphone era, showed that traditional, manual contact-tracing protocols become useless when the rate of non-symptomatic spreading, θ, is too high. By contrast, app-based approaches allow for \"recursive\" contact tracing, whereby contacts of contacts can be traced to an arbitrary recursive depth, at no additional cost. The effectiveness of recursive contact tracing has been studied in previous work; mathematically rigorous results exist for purely symptomatic transmission [15, 16] and detailed numerical simulations have been performed that take non-symptomatic transmission into account [17] . Some recent works have provided quantitative estimates for the effectiveness of contact-tracing, both non-recursive and recursive, in the specific context of COVID-19 [5, 6, 12] . Our results should be viewed as complementary to these studies. One comparative advantage of the model that we propose is its simplicity; in particular, it provides a natural starting point for understanding the universal properties of the contact-tracing phase transition.\\nSuppose we have an epidemic spreading through an infinite population of susceptibles, in discrete time, and infecting a number R of the population at each time step (here, R is an \"effective reproduction number\" that depends on the detailed properties of the epidemic spread, including the basic reproduction number R 0 ). This is a generic model for a spreading epidemic at short times. The total number of infections I tot scales as\\nand if R < 1, the epidemic has been controlled. We want to understand which R best captures the effect of mobile-phone-based contact tracing. From a statistical physics perspective, R is the single relevant parameter controlling the epidemic spread, and the key question is which \"microscopic\" degrees of freedom must be included to obtain a realistic estimate for R.\\nTo this end, we consider three parameters which implicitly determine R : the fraction of the population that will present asymptomatic cases (θ), the fraction of the population using a contact tracing application (φ), and the basic reproduction number for an individual who All rights reserved.

An illustrative realization of our branching-process model. a) An in-network asymptomatic person (CA) infects R0 = 3 people, whose category of infection is chosen independently and uniformly subject to parameters θ, the fraction of the population that presents asymptomatic cases, and φ, the fraction of the population using a contact-tracing app. b) A CS infection triggers an alert on the contact network, but the CS person and everybody else in their generation is still able to infect people before the contact network is triggered (while we depict RS = 2, we also simulate more realistic values RS = 0, 1). The arrows show the alerts sent to everyone connected to the CS individual by the contact network. c) Once the alert is sent out, everybody in the contact-networkconnected component of the CS individual can be quarantined immediately (thick circles) without giving rise to further disease spread, since they are in the latent (non-contagious) periods of their infections. Everyone outside the contact network continue to infect people as usual. The \"recursive\" aspect of such contact tracing corresponds to the arrow going back in time in Fig. (1b) ; the middle branch of infections would be missed by a traditional, non-recursive approach.\\neventually shows symptoms (R S ). R S is a combined measure of the number of pre-symptomatic infections and the efficacy of quarantine: in the limit of perfect isolation after showing symptoms, R S is precisely the number of people that a symptomatic individual infects during their Ω period, as defined above. We assume that R S is independent of whether a symptomatic individual is on the contact-tracing network or not.\\nThe effects of these parameters on the growth of the epidemic (or R) are studied using a simple branchingprocess model, where all infectious individuals are either symptomatic (S) or asymptomatic (A), and either on the app-based contact tracing network (C) or not (N). In an an uncontrolled setting, all types of infectious cases are assumed to proliferate with R 0 = 3, which is a reasonable estimate [18] for COVID-19 1 . Suppose that the outbreak starts from a single infected individual at time t = 0. In our discrete time (generational) model, this person infects R 0 other people at time t = 1, and each new infection is allotted one of the categories {CA, CS, N A, N S} randomly, with probabilities that are determined by the values of θ and φ. Individuals infected at the beginning of each generation are assumed not to infect anyone else after that generation has elapsed. Whenever a symptomatic person on the contact network (CS) is encountered during this branching process, the contact network is triggered, and all people connected by the network through past and present infections are placed in quarantine. As discussed earlier, since pre-symptomatic infections are common for COVID-19, our model includes the possibility that a CS person infects R S people by the time they trigger the contact network. As a consequence, non-CS people in the same generation also infect the next generation before the activation of the contact network (see Fig. 1c ). A few time-steps of the model are illustrated explicitly in Fig. 1 , together with the implementation of recursive contact tracing via removing connected components of the contact graph. Different combinations of the parameters θ, φ and R S lead to an effective reproduction number R distinct from the bare reproduction number R 0 , and we expect epidemic growth to be suppressed whenever R < 1.\\nNumerical simulations of this model were performed on 10, 000 nodes with 100 initial infections; the results are summarized in Fig. 2 . The location of the phase boundaries were verified to be independent of both doubling the system size and doubling the number of samples averaged per point shown on the phase diagram, to within the resolution of the phase diagram. Our numerics are consistent with the hypothesis that for any given fraction of asymptomatic transmission 0 ≤ θ < 1, and any presymptomatic reproduction number 0 ≤ R S ≤ R 0 , there is a critical point φ c (θ), corresponding to the onset of \"digital herd immunity\": epidemic control occurs for a fraction of app owners φ c (θ) < φ ≤ 1. For realistic COVID-19 parameter values, R 0 = 3, R S = 1 and θ = 0.2 − 0.5 [5, 18] , we find that φ c (θ) = 75% − 95%, illustrating that when both presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission are taken into account, the rate of app coverage necessary to prevent an epidemic can be rather high. Some practical implications of this point are raised in the final discussion. 1 There are also some higher estimates in the literature, e.g. based on the early epidemic dynamics in Wuhan [19] . Given the greatly increased state of awareness of the disease at this point it seems reasonable to assume that such higher values are not relevant to disease dynamics today.\\nAll rights reserved.

RS denotes the basic reproduction number for pre-symptomatic transmission. Each phase diagram was generated from 4000 microscopic simulations of 20 generations of disease evolution on 10, 000 nodes, of which 100 nodes were initially infected at random. A black square denotes epidemic control (average growth in the cumulative number of infections over the generations 16 − 20 is less than 0.25% of total population). This is grayscaled continuously to white for late-time growth exceeding 2.5% per generation or full epidemic spread before 20 generations have elapsed. Dashed red curves denote the mean-field approximation to the phase boundary, θ = θc(φ) derived in Sec. II C. The exact critical point for θ = 0 and RS = 2, derived in Appendix A, is marked by a cyan arrow. Bottom: Sample simulations from the encircled region in the RS = 0 phase diagram. Curves (solid) denote cumulative number of infections as a percentage of total population, averaged over 10 samples (dashed), with θ = 0.5 fixed and φ varied from φ = 0.6 to φ = 0.9.\\nTo understand the connection between our model and the theory of phase transitions, it it helpful to consider the limit of no contact tracing, i.e. φ = 0, and no pre-symptomatic transmission, R S = 0. In this case, symptomatic individuals act as though they were immune, since they cannot transmit the infection further. Along the line φ = 0, the model exhibits a transition from an \"immune phase\" to an \"epidemic phase\" for θ ≥ θ c = 1/R 0 , as shown in Fig. 2 . In fact, when φ = 0 and R S = 0, our model maps exactly to site percolation on a Bethe lattice with coordination number z = 1 + R 0 , where \"site percolation\" is equivalent to the existence of an infinite cluster of asymptomatic infections. The connection between simple epidemic models and percolation transitions has been noted in the past [20, 21] .\\nBy contrast, the non-local structure of recursive contact tracing, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , suggests that the universality class of the immune-to-epidemic transition for φ > 0 is distinct from standard site percolation. Nevertheless, in Appendix A we show that for a population without asymptomatic infections (the line θ = 0 in our phase diagram), we can obtain the critical fraction φ c of app usage exactly, for general values of R 0 , such that an epidemic occurs for φ ≤ φ c and is suppressed for φ > φ c . The calculation proceeds by self-consistently estimating the probability of formation of infinitely long chains of infections, mirroring the standard techniques of percolation theory [22] . In the presence of a finite fraction of asymptomatic people (θ = 0), we rely on a mean-field estimate for the location of the critical line (φ, θ c (φ)) as a function of R S ; detailed studies of the exact location of critical line and the universal features of the contacttracing phase transition are left to future work.\\nTo derive a \"mean-field\" description of our model, let us label the possible states of an infected individual by α ∈ {CA, CS, N A, N S}. The probability that an initial infectious node i is in state α is denoted P(i = α). According to their respective fractions in the population, we have\\nSuppose now that the node i = α is infectious at time t = 0 and adjacent to a susceptible node j. The probability of epidemic spread is determined by the probability of transmission from the node i = α to j and onwards, which we denote p α . This can be approximated as\\nwhere P(j = β|i = α) denotes the probability that node j is infectious and in state β at time t = 1, given that the node i was in state α at time t = 0, and we make a \"meanfield\" approximation whereby only two-node processes are taken into account. The latter clearly breaks down when recursive contact tracing is taken into account, a point that we shall return to below. In terms of these probabilities p α and the basic reproduction numbers for the various states R α , the effective reproduction number in our mean-field approximation is given by\\nAll rights reserved.

Throughout this section we assume R CA = R N A = R 0 and R CS = R N S = R S .\\nLet us first consider transmission by individuals off the contact network. Since such individuals can transmit the disease freely, we have simply\\nMoving on to symptomatic individuals on the contact network (CS), we obtain the following conditional probabilities:\\nwhich reflects the fact that on-network transmission from symptomatic individuals cannot generate transmission beyond node j (c.f. Fig. 1 ). Then, using Eqs. (2), (3) and (6), we find\\nFinally, we consider asymptomatic infections on the contact network (CA). While the probabilities of transmitting infection outside the contact network are the same as Eq. (6), the transmission probabilities within the contact network are undetermined at the level of meanfield theory. As a first approximation, we can introduce variational parameters 0 ≤ γ 1 , γ 2 ≤ 1 which interpolate between \"best\" and \"worst\" cases for epidemic control, to wit\\nIn the \"best\" case, γ 1 = γ 2 = 0, asymptomatic transmission within the network is completely suppressed, i.e. P(j = CA | i = CA) = P(j = CS | i = CA) = 0. In the \"worst\" case, γ 1 = γ 2 = 1, asymptomatic transmission within the network is not suppressed at all, and P(j =\\nproportional to the population fraction of the respective states. In these limits, we obtain\\nWhile this provides some useful rules-of-thumb, there is seemingly no consistent way to fix the variational parameters γ 1 and γ 2 within this approach. Since the best approximation is likely to lie in between these extreme limits, we consider a naïve linear interpolation and set\\nWe can fix the variational parameter γ self-consistently by noting that the critical line on the φ − θ phase diagram ought to pass through the point (φ = 1, θ = 1), since there is an epidemic for {φ < 1, θ = 1}, when the population is entirely asymptomatic but not entirely on the contact network, and no epidemic for {φ = 1, θ < 1}, when the population is entirely on the contact network but not entirely asymptomatic. We find that setting γ = 1 − 1/R 0 ensures this condition, and thus obtain the following estimate for the effective reproduction number:\\nAn alternative approach is to derive a self-consistent estimate for p CA directly, by explicitly taking into account some of the higher-order, multi-node processes of transmission. The key observation is that an infectious node i = CA can infect a susceptible neighbour j in only three ways that allow for continued transmission; either infection is transmitted directly off the contact network, i → j ∈ {N A, N S}, infection is transmitted off the contact network via a pre-symptomatic, on-network intermediary, i → j = CS → k ∈ {N A, N S}, or transmission is perpetuated by another asymptomatic node j ∈ CA on the contact network. To account for these three possibilities, we can write down a self-consistent equation for p CA ,\\nwhich yields\\nThe approximations of Eqs. (5), (7) , and (13) then imply\\nThe critical thresholds R = 1 predicted by Eqs. (11) and (14) are almost indistinguishable on the phase diagrams with R 0 = 3. In Fig. 2 we show the critical curves predicted by Eq. (14) and find good agreement with numerical simulations.\\nThese mean-field approaches therefore capture the approximate location of the critical curve (φ, θ c (φ)) (equivalently (φ c (θ), θ)), and thus the essential qualitative features of recursive contact tracing with non-symptomatic transmission.\\nWe have introduced a simple branching-process model for early-stage epidemic spread, which both retains a degree of analytical and numerical tractability and is All rights reserved.

Using this model we obtained predictions for realistic COVID-19 parameter values, finding that in order for a contact-tracing app to be effective, the fraction of app take-up among a given population would need to lie between 75% and 95%, depending on the frequency of asymptomatic transmission.\\nWe now consider the practical applicability of our results to India, whose particular challenges provided the initial stimulus for this work. At first sight, India\\'s overall smartphone coverage of around 40% [23] suggests that it might be difficult to attain \"digital herd immunity\" using solely app-based contact tracing [11] . However, smartphone-based measures could be combined with other tracing efforts to compensate for the limited availability of smartphones. Specifically, more traditional interview methods can still be used to reconstruct the location history of a newly diagnosed person. Systematic, random testing might also help in this regard [24] . As almost 90% [23] of Indians use some sort of wireless phone, alerts from people on the app-based network as well as interview-based alerts could be broadcast via SMS and combined with cell tower triangulation for spatial resolution in addition to the temporal resolution that would already be available. Major metropolitan areas, which include a number of COVID-19 hot-spots [25] , would be particularly well-suited to such a dual approach, since they exhibit both higher smartphone coverage and a higher density of cell-phone towers, allowing for more accurate triangulation [26] . Finally, it seems entirely possible to boost smartphone ownership for this purpose by the use of donated used phones and subsidized data provided to run the contact tracing app.\\nSeveral natural questions arise for future work. From a practical standpoint, one worthwhile extension of our model would be to allow for a degree of stochasticity in the basic reproduction number R 0 , for example, by simulating the branching-process model on small-world networks with varying degree per node, which are known to better reflect realistic human contact networks [27, 28] than networks with fixed degree. Indeed, network structure has previously been shown to influence the effectiveness of contact tracing [4, [29] [30] [31] . Meanwhile, an important open problem from the perspective of statistical physics is pinning down the universality class of the contact-tracing transition. Our study of the critical point along the line θ = 0 indicates that techniques from percolation theory are likely to be useful; on the other hand, the non-local character of recursive contact tracing distinguishes it from the percolation transitions that have arisen in related applications [20, 21, 32, 33] , and suggests that the critical exponents at the transition point differ from those of standard site percolation, even on the Bethe lattice. We leave a detailed exploration of these fascinating questions to subsequent studies.\\nSolving Eqs. (A2) and (A3) simultaneously, we obtain the critical point φ = φ c , such that p N = p C = 0 for φ > φ c . We now illustrate the computation of φ c for a general R 0 = R. The probabilities p N and p C for this case can be written analogously to Eqs. (A2) and (A3) as\\nSubstituting Eq. (A5) in Eq. (A4), and using f C + f N = 1, we obtain\\nExcluding the p N = 0 solution, we can simplify Eq.

This result matches our numerical phase diagram to within the resolution of the plot, improving upon the mean-field prediction of the main text; see Fig. 2 for an example with R = 2.', \"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has a significant impact on the health care systems with an enormous socio-economic burden worldwide. 1 Since December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread around the globe starting from Wuhan, China. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed mid of May 2020 that there are >5 million people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 340 000 deaths worldwide. 4 Because of the exponential growth of infections in the early phase of the pandemia, hospitals from countries all over the world including China, the USA, Spain, and Italy were struggling to cope with Covid-19 patients. 5, 6 In many places, there was a lack of intensive care unit resources including mechanical ventilators, personal protective equipment supplies, and medical staff. 7, 8 As a result of the experience from these Covid-19 hotspots, many countries decreed a lockdown of public life with the goal of social distancing to control the expansion of the virus. 9, 10 In this context, hospitals in Germany and other countries were obliged by national and local health care authorities to create Covid-19 resources, focus on the management of Covid-19 related aspects including hospital-wide implementation of rigorous hygiene rules, and postponement of all non-emergency procedures including coronary angiography for stable coronary artery disease (CAD). 8, 11 Guideline-recommended emergency interventions for acute coronary syndromes were never restricted during the Covid-19 outbreak. 12-14 Nevertheless, cardiologists and other health care professionals all over the world reported a remarkable reduction in the number of patient admitted for acute coronary syndromes. 8, [15] [16] [17] [18] Therefore, we investigated the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes, in-hospital death, major cardiac complications, patient characteristics, severity of presentation, and cardiac outcome for all patients who presented at the cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) starting from 1 March to 30 April 2020 ('early-Covid-19 pandemic = e-COV') and compared them with those of all patients admitted before, starting from 1 January to 29 February ('pre-Covid-19 time = pre-COV').\\nWe performed a single-centre cross-sectional observational analysis of all patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome [either ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI)] to the Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology at Charité University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum between 1 January to 30 April 2020. For comparison, data were also obtained for January to April 2019. Our centre is a tertiary-care cardiovascular centre with cardiovascular surgery on site, offering 24/7 coronary intervention availability according to current guidelines. 12 A total of 355 patients were included (208 on January-April 2019; 96 on January-February 2020; and 51 on March and April 2020). The Covid-19 pandemic has reached Germany on 27 January. In consequence, federal and state authorities implemented a stepwise strategy to reduce mobility and motivate the community to social distancing in order to control the outbreak and prevent exhaustion of the health care system. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) provided the country with daily actual information about the new SARS-CoV-2 referring to the official WHO numbers. 4 In cooperation with Humboldt University of Berlin, the RKI analysed anonymized mobility flows in Germany, which were gathered from mobile phone data. 19 It could be demonstrated that mobility dramatically dropped in Germany starting from the beginning of March with a peak between mid of March to mid of April (time of the so-called lockdown in Germany 19 ). Besides largely reduced mobility due to the countrywide lockdown and reduced availability of general practitioner and cardiology outpatient services, patients were concerned of SARS-CoV-2 infection by getting in contact with the health care system. In consequence, reduced availability of non-emergent medical care, as well as individual concerns on the risks of health care contacts, may have impact on the clinical course of CAD from stable to unstable. The main aim of the study was to demonstrate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalization and in-hospital death for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A time delay in admissions for AMI (time from symptom onset to first medical contact) with consecutive prolonged ischaemic time should be evaluated with biomarkers for myocardial injury [high-sensitivity troponin (troponin hs) and creatine kinase (CK)]. Additionally, the persistent myocardial damage -represented as the maximum of CK and its myocardial isoform (CK-MB)-should be investigated during Covid-19 in all AMIs. Furthermore, we investigate the time from symptom onset to first medical contact in all AMI patients as well as the door to balloon time in STEMI patients and the time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on major cardiac complications, as a composite endpoint of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock-defined by systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for at least 30 min with evidence of poor tissue perfusion after correction of non-myocardial factors and life-threating arrhythmias [sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VFib)]-should be investigated in all AMIs. Finally, to evaluate cardiac outcome, we measured the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %) with echocardiography as an important parameter for cardiac function and additionally determined a specific biomarker for heart failure incidence [N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP)] in all AMI patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. The collection of clinical and laboratory data was performed using an electronic data storage software and was cross-checked by the investigators.\\nContinuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median with inter-quartile range. Categorical values were presented as absolute values or percentages. Comparison of continuous variables was performed by Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test. The χ 2 tests were used for comparison of categorical values. A two-sided P-value of 334 U. Primessnig et al.\\n.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).\\nAltogether, 355 AMIs, including STEMI and NSTEMI, were analysed in this study. There was a remarkable decrease in AMI patients during the Covid-19 outbreak in March and April 2020 compared to January and February 2020, as well as to the previous year 2019, who presented at the CCL at the Department of Cardiology Charité University Hospital Berlin -Campus Virchow in Germany.\\nReduced hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and increased mortality during early COVID-19 pandemic Between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020, a total number of 147 AMIs were registered at the CCL. We analysed the AMIs in the pre-Covid-19 time (determined 1 January to 29 February 2020 = 'pre-COV') and compared them with the AMIs during the early-Covid-19 outbreak in Berlin (determined 1 March to 30 April 2020 = 'e-COV'). There was an enormous decrease in the hospitalization for AMI of 47% (absolute numbers: 96 to 51 AMI) during the COVID-19 outbreak in Berlin. However, case fatality rate for AMI increased significantly from 5.2% to 17.7% (+12.5% with P < 0.05) during the same time. See Figure 1 and Table S1 .\\nFurthermore, we analysed the AMIs during January and April 2019 and compared the numbers of AMIs and deaths with those in the respective months in 2020. A total number of 208 AMIs were registered during the first 4 months in 2019 (41% more compared with the same time in 2020). In January and February, there was no difference in terms of the admission rate for AMI, while starting in March (reduction around 47% in 2020 compared with 2019) and especially in April (decrease of 56% in 2020 to 2019), there was a substantial decrease in hospitalization for AMI. Mortality was in the same range in January and February 2020 and 2019 (rather a small reduction on February 2020 to 2019 of 4.2% to 8%). Indeed, the case fatality rate on March 2020 substantially increased from 7.4% in 2019 to 17.9% in 2020 (+10.5%) and on April 2019 from 5.6% to 17.4% in 2020 (+ 11.8%). See Figure 2 and Table S2 . \\nNo differences were registered in patient age [age: 70 (56.5-76) vs. 64 (58-72), P = ns] or sex (male: 69% vs. 70%, P = ns). Most of the patients presented with AMI had arterial hypertension (90% in pre-COV vs. 92% in e-COV, P = ns) and dyslipidaemia (74% in pre-COV vs. 78% in e-COV, p = ns). Fifty per cent, % of the patients were smokers and had been diagnosed with CAD with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Thirty per cent had prior MI, and 10% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery with no significant differences between the groups. Obesity, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease were similar in both groups. More details are listed in Table 1 .\\nIn the e-COV group, 51 AMIs were registered compared with 96 AMIs in the pre-COV group, which marks a decrease of 47%. In the e-COV group, 51% were STEMI and 49% were NSTEMI patients (compared with 36% STEMI and 64% NSTEMI in the pre-COV group). From patients in the e-COV group, 29% presented after resuscitation (compared with 22% in the pre-COV group, +7%), and 33% had initial cardiogenic shock (compared with 24% in the pre-COV group, +9%). Furthermore, 31% had life-threatening arrhythmias including VT and Vfib in the e-COV group (compared with 25% in the pre-COV group, +6%). After cardiac catheterization in 96% in the e-COV group and in 95% in the pre-COV group, a relevant stenosis of coronary arteries was responsible for the admission to the hospital. In 4%, a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in the early-Covid-19 group compared with 2% in the pre-Covid-19 group. Finally, 3% of the patients in the pre-Covid-19 group were diagnosed with a relevant myocarditis. For details, see Table 2 . The analysis of coronary angiography showed no difference regarding the culprit vessel, in either STEMI or NSTEMI patients during the e-COV and pre-COV time. Right coronary artery (RCA) was identified in 41% in e-COV and in 44% in pre-COV as culprit lesion; left anterior descending artery (LAD) was the culprit vessel in 33% in e-COV and in 29% in pre-COV and ramus circumflexus (RCx) was affected in 16% in e-COV and pre-COV. Moreover, successful revascularization of the culprit vessel was unchanged between pre-COV (96%) and e-COV (90%).\\nPatients with AMI presented with a more pronounced phenotype in e-COV compared with pre-COV. Markers for myocardial necrosis were significantly increased at first medical contact in e-COV time (troponin hs and CK, p < 0.0001). Initially measured LVEF (%) was more often reduced in patients with AMI in e-COV (p = 0.03). An interesting finding was that in the e-COV group, 51% need inotropic support (compared with 26% in the pre-COV group, +25%, p = 0.001), and 22% need mechanical haemodynamic support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO), Impella®, or both (compared with 10% in the pre-COV group, +12%, p = 0.1).\\nInvasive ventilation was needed in 35% of the AMIs in the e-COV group (compared with 23% in the pre-COV group, +12%). See Table 3 .\\nTime from symptom onset to first medical contact was substantially delayed in STEMI and NSTEMI patients during e-COV compared with pre-COV. Forty-three per cent of STEMI patients presented within the first 12 h from symptom onset to first medical contact in the pre-COV time, while only 23% of STEMI patients did that in the e-COV period. However, in pre-COV, only 6% of STEMI patients presented after 72 h, while in e-COV, 27% did, which was an increase of 21% (p = 0.04). In NSTEMI patients, 33% presented within the first 12 h to the hospital in pre-COV, while only 16% of them did in e-COV. Indeed, 28% of NSTEMI patients presented after 72 h during e-COV compared with only 6% in pre-COV, which was again an increase of >20% (p = 0.02) ( Figure 3A and B). Door to balloon time in STEMI patients was not significantly changed during e-COV compared with pre-COV ( Figure 3C ). In NSTEMI patients, the time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed during e-COV (p = 0.03) compared with pre-COV ( Figure 3D ).\\nMajor complications were defined as cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening arrhythmias (VT/Vfib) after initial successful revascularization of the culprit lesion. We noticed a significant increase of 11.3% in major complications in the early-Covid-19 group regarding cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), cardiogenic shock (CS), and VT/Vfib [pre-COV: 6.3% (9/96) and e-COV: 17.6% (10/51), p = 0.02] (Figure 4) . \\nIn our study, we determined an increase in the maximum of the cardiac-specific CK (CK-MB max, p = 0.05) and the maximum of CK (CK max, p = 0.04) during the early-Covid-19 pandemic as substantially increased markers for sustained myocardial damage. Additionally, we evaluated cardiac outcome using echocardiographic measured LVEF (%) and Increased measured high-sensitivity troponin (troponin hs, ng/L) and creatine kinase (CK, U/L) at first medical contact during early-Covid-19 (e-COV = 1 March to 30 April) pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 time (pre-COV = 1 January to 29 February) as a marker for myocardial injury and potentially caused through a prolonged myocardial ischaemic time. Higher percentage of reduced measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 45%) during e-COV compared with pre-COV at first medical contact. Higher use of inotropic support including dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, enoximone, and milrinone. Haemodynamic support including veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system (va-ECMO) and/or left ventricular microaxial pump system (Impella®). Data are absolute numbers or percentage. Statistical analysis was performed with χ 2 tests or Mann-Whitney test. Statistical significance was reached with a P < 0.05. NTproBNP as a relevant clinical biomarker for heart failure. We could demonstrate that LVEF (39 ± 16 vs. 46 ± 16, p = 0.01) after AMI was significantly lower during the early-Covid-19 pandemic and that NTproBNP levels (NTproBNP, ng/L: 9935 ± 12 922 vs. 5347 ± 8670, p = 0.03) were substantially increased, indicating a worse cardiac outcome and a higher incidence of heart failure after AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic. Days in hospital were unchanged for AMI during e-COV and pre-COV ( Figure 5 and Table S3 ).\\nIn our study, we could clearly demonstrate a dramatically reduced hospitalization for AMI and a significantly increased mortality for admitted AMI patients during the early-Covid-19 pandemic in a tertiary-care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Furthermore, we observed a time delay from symptom onset to first medical contact in STEMI and NSTEMI patients during e-COV. While door to balloon time in STEMI patients was not significantly changed, the time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients during the early-Covid-19 pandemic was significantly delayed. Consequently, time delay in admission with AMI was associated with a prolonged ischaemic time, leading to a more pronounced myocardial injury and damage at first medical contact represented as relevantly increased cardiac enzymes, reduced LVEF, and higher use of inotropic support. Moreover, major cardiac complications including cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening arrhythmias occurred substantially more often during the early-Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, it could be reported for the first time that patients admitted with AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic have a significantly worse cardiac short-term outcome in terms of lower LVEF and higher NTproBNP levels as a marker for heart failure.\\nIn fact, admissions for AMI were halved in the 2 months after the Covid-19 outbreak starting on 1 March in Berlin compared with January and February 2020 where no Covid-19 infection was recognized. However, case fatality rate of AMI significantly increased about 12.5% during the same time in the Covid-19 pandemic. A relation of the first 4 months (January to April) in 2020 to 2019 showed that hospitalization for AMI was not different in January and February of both years, while on March and April 2020, the admissions for AMI decreased nearly 50% in comparison with those in 2019. In the equivalent period, the mortality of AMI increased substantially about 10% in 2020 compared with 2019, while in the first 2 months, mortality was unchanged between the years. These findings are in line with other studies from Hong Kong, 15, 16 Italy, 20 Spain, 21 and the USA, 8, 18 where a decrease in AMI was reported. The potential mechanism leading to the reduction in admissions for MI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic is multifactorial. The recommendation of social distancing and avoiding congregation of people led to a substantial decrease in mobility on March and April 2020 compared with January and February 2020 as well as with the equivalent period in 2019. The RKI and the Humboldt University of Berlin analysed anonymized mobility flows in Germany, which are gathered from mobile phone data ('Covid-19-mobility project' 19 ). There was an initial drop in mobility up to À39% in mid-March 2020 until mid-April 2020 compared with the year 2019, recognized as representing the time of 'lockdown in Germany'. 19 The majority of hospitals and other health care services have postponed elective surgeries and cardiac procedures, including coronary angiography during the Covid-19 pandemic, to be prepared and have enough medical resources including intensive care units, personal protective equipment, and medical stuff. 8 Emergency response measurements, which are necessary and important for infection control, were implemented in the regular hospital operation procedures Figure 4 Major cardiac complications after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during Covid-19 pandemic: major cardiac complications after AMI represented as a composite endpoint of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) were significantly higher in early-Covid-19 (black bars: e-COV = 1 March to 30 April) pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 time (white bars: pre-COV = 1 January to 29 February). Data are percentage. Statistical analysis was performed with χ 2 tests. Statistical significance was reached with a P < 0.05. including regular temperature measurements, more common testing of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the early isolation of suspected infected patients. 15, 16, 20 Many patients with severe medical problems, including chest pain, tried to endure their symptoms until intolerance and did not seek out a hospital, because they are in fear of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the clinics. All these factors together potentially increased time to first medical contact and caused a further delay in adequate medical therapy. Regarding the treatment of AMI with PCI as recommended by the guidelines, this could lead to a prolonged ischaemic time and therefore an increased mortality and worse cardiac outcome. [11] [12] [13] [14] 22 We could not observe any differences in our patients during the Covid-19 pandemic regarding age, sex, or medical history including arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, known CADs with prior MI, PCI or CAGB, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the total number of AMI substantially decreased during the early-Covid-19 pandemic in Berlin (À47%), we recognized a small relative increase in STEMI (+15%) patients in our study. Studies from US CCLs 8 estimated 38% reduction in MI activations, while in Spain, 21 a 40% reduction was noticed. A multicentre analysis from Northern California even showed a decrease of 48% in AMI (including STEMI and NSTEMI patients) during the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in the USA. 18 Furthermore, there was a small increase in patients admitted to our CCL after cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (+7), with cardiogenic shock (+9%) or with initial life-threatening arrhythmias including VT or Vfib (+6%). Coronary angiography evaluation of the culprit vessel could not show any differences between the pre-COV and e-COV periods. Additionally, initial successful revisualization of the culprit vessel was similar in all patients. There are previous studies that investigated the time delay between symptom onset and hospital admissions for STEMI patients 8 as well as the substantially increased time from first medical contact to coronary revascularization. 15, 20 In our study, we could demonstrate a relevant time delay from symptom onset to first medical contact for STEMI and NSTEMI patients. However, door to balloon time was unchanged in STEMI during e-COV. Time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients on the other hand was significantly prolonged during e-COV. These delays consecutively lead to a prolongation of the total ischaemic time after MI. As a potential result of the prolonged ischaemic time, patients with AMI during e-COV presented with a substantially more pronounced phenotype to the hospitals. The severity of the presentation was reflected by a significant increase in initial measured troponin and CK at first medical contact. Furthermore, in 45% of the patients in e-COV, the measured LVEF was mild to severely reduced compared with 20% in the pre-COV period. Additionally, patients who presented with AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic needed substantially more inotropic support compared with the pre-COV time. Furthermore, we could report that the total damage of myocardium after AMI was higher during the early-Covid-19 pandemic, which was represented as significantly higher amount of maximum values for CK and CK-MB. Besides these findings, we evaluated cardiac function with echocardiographic measured LVEF during hospitalization. We could demonstrate a significantly lower LVEF as marker for a more impaired cardiac function after AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, we recognized a significant increase of the biomarker NTproBNP in AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic, which led us to the conclusion that patients with AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic have a worse cardiac outcome and a higher incidence of heart failure. In accordance with previous reports, 15, 16, 20 we observed a significantly higher rate of major cardiac complications including CPR, CS, and VT in AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nTo summarize, in our study, we could demonstrate a substantially reduced hospitalization for AMI as well as a significant increase in mortality and major cardiac complications during the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in a tertiary university care hospital in Berlin, Germany. Time delay in admission and medical treatment for AMI resulted in the prolongation in myocardial ischaemic time. We could demonstrate that a prolonged myocardial ischaemic time was reflected by a significant increase in cardiac enzymes like troponin hs and CK at first medical contact after AMI during Covid-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we recognized a substantially higher use of inotropic support after AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic as an expression of worse cardiac function. Moreover, we were able to show that patients who suffered from an AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic had a more pronounced myocardial damage represented as higher CK max and CK-MB max values. Finally, patients had worse cardiac short-term outcome represented as lower LVEF and higher incidence of heart failure represented as increased NTproBNP levels in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic.\\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has a substantial impact on reduced admission rates and may cause treatment delay in AMI related to a prolonged ischaemic time. This leads to a higher mortality, more severe cardiac complications, and a worse cardiac short-term outcome of AMI patients during the Covid-19 outbreak in a tertiary-care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Our data indicate that Covid-19 impacts on non-infectious disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes. Therefore, it is important that health care professionals including cardiologists, do not forget their actual patient population and treat them in compliance with recent guidelines besides the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection all over the world.\\nClinical data collection during a pandemic emergency is challenging, and resources are restricted. Most of in-hospital processes underwent reorganization with the focus on patient care and infection protection. Nevertheless, we collected data to investigate the impact of the early-Covid-19 pandemia on the admission and mortality rate of AMI in a tertiary-care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. To avoid losing important and relevant patient information, we cross-checked reports from our CCL with the emergency room and intensive care unit Myocardial infarction during Covid-19 pandemic reports. Extensive data collection during the initial phase of a pandemia was not possible. Therefore, we had to focus on the most important and available facts that we can obtain from our patient population and have to leave out nonessential but potentially interesting variables like clinical risk scores in all STEMI and NSTEMI patients. For the same reason, the study period was limited to the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in Berlin. The short time period of 2 months for data collection represents a source for potential bias. Finally, as this study was a single-centre observational study, we just described a phenomenon, and no demonstration of a clear cause can be drawn. Table S1 .

According to Chinese authorities\\' recommendations and fear of COVID-19, people were reluctant to go outside from late January through March 2020. The aetiology, transmission routes, treatments, outcomes, control, and prevention of COVID-19 are receiving much research attention. 6 However, as the outbreak prolonged, its potential impacts on dental education should not be overlooked.\\nOur previous studies showed the dental services provision and people\\'s utilisation of dental services have been strongly influenced by COVID-19 epidemic. 7, 8 The public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatments whilst providing emergency dental services, 7 and the private dental offices were completely closed. The number of emergency dental visitors reduced at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic. 8 Within the limited studies, we can report with confidence that dental professionals had more free time at their disposal than previously.\\nBefore the epidemic, lack of time was the most important barrier to attending continuing education activities that contribute to the career-long learning and personal development of dental professionals. 9 Therefore, some dentists used the free time to take part in continuing dental education to update theoretic knowledge and clinical skills.\\nAlthough in-person continuing education remains the most frequent and most preferred format, distance education is gaining in popularity with dental profession as it is accessible and flexible in terms of when and where it is used. 10 Distance education provides knowledge to learners who are not physically \"on-site\" to receive their learning. 11 The non-face-to-face approach overcomes the place constraint in traditional educational settings. It thus has great advantages in the period of COVID-19 epidemic that holds people back from meeting up. Live online is a synchronous and live virtual classroom delivered to personal intelligent terminals such as smartphones, laptops and tablet computers via the Internet. It is one of the most dynamic, enriching forms and well-received methods of distance education. 12 In the light of these findings, the present study aimed to assess live online dental continuing education during COVID-19 epidemic in China. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between live online dental courses before and during COVID-19 epidemic.\\nThe institutions providing live online dental courses in China dur- \\nThe percentages of offline and online courses provided by 21 dental continuing education institutions before COVID-19 epidemic were 95.2% (20 out of 21) and 28.6% (6 out of 21) respectively, including 23.8% (5 out of 21) institutions provided both courses simultaneously. However, all institutions suspended offline courses during COVID-19 epidemic (Table 1 ). There was a significant difference before and during the epidemic (P < .001). The dental continuing education courses have been transferred from offline to online dramatically. All live online courses were lectures, with no practical training provided. Table 2 ). The total number of online courses for 10 weeks before the epidemic was 33, and that for 2 weeks during the epidemic was 119 (Table 3 ). It was observed that live online dental continuing education increased significantly during COVID-19 epidemic. In terms of time distribution of live online dental courses retrieved in this study, the proportion of courses provided within working time raised from 6.1% (2 out of 33) of pre-COVID-19 to 46.2% (55 out of 119) during COVID-19 (Table 3 ). There was a significant difference between the test and control periods (P < .001).\\nOverview of course types provided by 21 dental continuing education institutions (n (%)) | 3 LIU et aL.\\nThis research study\\'s aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on dental continuing education in China. As such, the study tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference between live online courses before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results indicated live online dental continuing education increased significantly during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected.\\nSeveral reasons may account for the recent and sustained growth and acceptance of continuing dental education. 13 It is recognised that education is a key factor in economic development and social change. 14 In terms of dentistry, the sciences and technologies are undergoing rapid development, and therefore, the related knowledge needs to be continuously updated. The role of career-long learning is understood because of its importance in ensuring professional competency, providing optimal patient care and career advancement. 15 However, lack of time was the most important barrier for dentists to attend continuing education activities. 9 The present study showed the dentists were more involved in continuing education during the COVID-19 epidemic, which may because they have more free time than previously. 7 The number of courses, duration and the number of participants increased significantly during the epidemic. Besides, as most dentists were free from clinical work, 7 more courses were provided within working time than before.\\nNowadays, a variety of learning modes are open to dentists in the world. Distance learning activities are designed to fit the specific environment for education 14 and provide knowledge and skills in which geographic location separates teachers and learners. The preference for continuing education provision modes differs enormously between participants from different countries, with a preference for distance learning varying from 9% to 42%. 13 Studies have reported mixed results about the preference of asynchronous and synchronous online learning and were no consensus yet. 16, 17 Online courses have been shown to be as effective as traditional in-person education in medical education literatures. 18, 19 And the synchronous interactive distance dental education delivery approach was as effective as traditional means. 20, 21 The live online course offers appealing educational alternatives and provides learning opportunities for those whom a traditional on-site education setting does not work currently. These courses enable a more relaxed environment with real-time interactions amongst all participants and may be helpful to dental practitioners who do not have daily contact with other professional colleagues. The willingness of dentists to engage in live online learning suggests that this mode of education may have great potential in the future.\\nDistance education is different from traditional education, so several requirements are necessary for it to be successful. In this context, hardware technology, internet connection and the ability to use media are very important. 14 Besides objective conditions, the focus of responsibility shifts from the teacher to the pupil, and distant learners might hardly motivate themselves to stay longer on distance learning. 14 Therefore, distance education may be not for every learner. Consequently, to ensure successful and high standards of distance education, care is needed. 14 More attention should be given to the learner\\'s needs and level of learner engagement 13 as interaction is a key component in distance education. 17 The weakness of the current study is that the information on dental continuing education institutions and courses provided was limited. Online courses were hard to search as there was no consistency in how they were posted and the terms used by the institutions. The study assessed live online dental course availability and number of participants under a specific public health emergency but did not evaluate course completion rates or course quality. Further studies about the comprehensive state of online dental continuing education during COVID-19 epidemic are necessary.\\nWithin the limitations of this study, the results show that live online dental continuing education increased significantly during COVID-19 epidemic. The Chinese dentists actively used their disposable time for self-professional development whilst controlling and preventing the transmission of COVID-19.\\nThe authors paid tribute to all who contributed to fighting against COVID-19. ', 'Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis and is the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). Since 1974, BCG vaccination has been included in the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization. It is estimated that more than 3 billion individuals have been immunized with BCG and over 100 million doses of BCG are administered annually. Multiple studies have confirmed that BCG is generally safe and can protect children against disseminated disease, including tuberculosis meningitis [1, 2] . BCG also provides cross-protection against leprosy [3] . However, the success of BCG against pulmonary TB in adults is still debated, since randomized clini-cal trials have reported protection efficacy ranging from 0-80% [4, 5] . Several hypotheses for the variation in observed efficacy have been proposed [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nOne explanation concerns the heterogeneity of the BCG strains [6] . The original BCG was derived from a virulent strain of M. bovis isolated from a cow. From 1908 through 1921, this isolate was subjected to 230 passages on glycerinated potato bile medium, which generated an attenuated strain termed BCG [10] . Distribution and widespread use of BCG started around 1924 and was accompanied by changes in the manufacturing process in production facilities. For instance, while BCG in Sweden was transferred without interruption from bile potato to bile potato medium in accordance with Calmette\\'s original practice [11] , BCG production in Denmark involved alternating rounds of growth on potato bile medium and Sauton broth until 1949 when it was grown exclusively in Sauton medium [12] . Prior to the establishment of seed stocks in the 1960s, BCG was passaged continuously, and the changes in media and transfer schedules contributed to the \"in vitro evolution\" of BCG [6] . It is estimated that as many as 49 production substrains have been used at one time or another in various parts of the world [13] , including the four major BCG vaccines in current use (BCG-Pasteur, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Japan) [14] . The relative protective efficacy of BCG substrains is currently unknown [6, 15] .\\nAnecdotal reports have long indicated that BCG substrains exhibit phenotypic differences in growth characteristics, biochemical activities, ability to protect against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and residual virulence [16] . Over the past decade, numerous groups have sought to identify the genomic changes responsible for these phenotypes. The earliest whole genome comparisons confirmed that BCG was indeed related to, but distinct from M. tb and M. bovis [17] [18] [19] . Subsequent analyses of multiple vaccine strains have uncovered extensive genome diversity including both deletions and duplications in BCG substrains [18, [20] [21] [22] . The phylogeny established by these molecular methods is consistent with the historical records of BCG dissemination [20, 23, 24] . For example, BCG strains acquired after 1927 exhibit the RD2 deletion, while nRD18 is only deleted in strains obtained after 1933. Other genomic changes are exclusive to individual daughter strains, and are associated with vaccine production at specific locations [22, 24] .\\nA number of molecular techniques have been used to investigate genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Early efforts using subtractive hybridization [18] and spotted oligonucleotide arrays [20, 22, 25] effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. More recently, complete genome sequencing has enabled high-resolution analysis of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 [24] , but sequences for other BCG lineages have yet to be determined. To identify potential genomic polymorphisms in other BCG substrains, we have employed a tiling array platform developed by Nim-bleGen Systems. This DNA microarray-based comparative genome sequencing technique allows high resolution detections of sequence polymorphisms [26] [27] [28] . Using this technique, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified a number of novel genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes that are known virulence factors and are expected to have a major impact on the immunogenicity and efficacy of individual vaccine strains.\\nWe have used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of 13 BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau, -Sweden, -Birkhaug, -China, -Prague, -Glaxo, -Danish, -Tice, -Phipps, -Frappier and -Pasteur. All of these strains, except BCG-China, have previously been subjected to genomic analysis by other methods [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . The complete genome sequence of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 is available [24] . The same BCG-Pasteur strain was included in the analysis to serve as an internal control for our experiments in addition to validating the NimbleGen technique. In each experiment, genomic DNA from M. tb H37Rv [29] acted as the common referent.\\nA total of 42 deletions were identified. Twenty-five of these have been described previously [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . Thirteen more represent transposons (e.g., IS6110) present in the referent strain (M. tb H37Rv), but absent from the M. bovis and BCG lineages [24, 29, 30] . Six duplications were identified, four (DU1, DU2-I, -II, -III) of which have been described previously [21, 24] . These results confirm the validity of our approach, and the utility of tiling arrays for comparative genomics. A total of 4 novel deletions and 2 duplications were identified in our analysis. These novel deletions and duplications are described below.\\nTwo deletions specific to BCG-Moreau were identified. The first is a 975 bp deletion ( Table 1 ) that eliminates the distal end of fadD26 (Rv2930/BCG2952) and the start of ppsA (Rv2931/BCG2953). These genes are part of the genetic locus required for the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) [31] , two cell wall lipids known to be important for the virulence of M. tb and M. bovis [32] [33] [34] . In previous work, we demonstrated that BCG-Moreau does not pro-duce PDIMs or PGLs [35] , which is now explained by the fadD26-ppsA deletion identified in the current study.\\nThe second novel polymorphism in BCG-Moreau is an 1128 bp deletion within Rv3887c/BCG3942c (Table 1) . Although intact in other BCG substrains, this region overlaps with a 2.4-kb deletion (termed RDpan) found in some M. bovis strains [36] , including the sequenced strain, AF2122/97 [30] . The Rv3887c/BCG3942c gene encodes a membrane transport protein and is part of the ESX-2 type VII secretion system [37] . The role of the ESX-2 system in virulence is unknown considering its variable presence among clinical M. bovis isolates from both France and England [36] . However, loss of the Rv3887c membrane transporter likely eliminates the secretion of ESAT-6-and CFP-10-like antigens [37] and influences the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain.\\nTwo novel deletions were identified in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug. These polymorphisms are identical between the two BCG strains, which is consistent with their genealogy [24] . The first deletion comprises 110 bp and disrupts the promoter and translational start site of whiB3 (Rv3416/BCG3486) [see Additional file 1]. The other is a 245 bp deletion within trcR (Rv1033c/ BCG1091c) ( Table 1 ). Both genes encode transcriptional regulators known to impact virulence.\\nWhiB3 belongs to a family of seven M. tb transcriptional regulatory proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters and are predicted to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli [38] . WhiB3 responds to oxygen and nitric oxide, and is important for regulation of carbon metabolism [39] . The deletion of whiB3 in M. bovis attenuates in vivo growth in guinea pigs [40] . TrcR is the response regulator of the TrcR-TrcS two-component system. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype such that the strain exhibits increased lethality in SCID mice [41] .\\nAlthough the genomic profiles of BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Sweden are similar, we have also found that BCG-Birkhaug is distinguished by a strain-specific duplication, named DU-Birkhaug. This spans the origin of replication and is analogous to the DU1 duplication in BCG-Pasteur [21, 24] (Fig. 1A) . However, the borders of the DU-Birkhaug are different. Whereas DU1 encompasses 29.6 kb from Rv3910 to pknB/Rv0014, DU-Birkhaug spans a slightly different region, from trxB/Rv3913 to rodA/ Rv0017c. Most of the genes in these regions are involved with DNA replication and cell division. Unlike DU1, DU-Birkhaug also appears to be in a genomic location distant to its original copy. Initial PCR-based attempts to characterize the boundaries of this duplication assumed that the second copy was nearby failed to detect a product (data not shown). As such, the genome location of DU-Birkhaug remains unknown.\\nOur analysis also revealed a novel duplication in the genome of BCG-Tice termed DU-Tice. It comprises a 22kb duplication that encompasses Rv1782-Rv1800 (Fig.  1B ). The precise boundaries and location of this duplication were determined using primers at the junction (Fig.  1C) . Interestingly, DU-Tice encodes the ESX-5 secretion system [37, 42] . This includes several conserved membrane transporters (Rv1782, Rv1783, Rv1795, and Rv1797), a membrane associated ATPase (Rv1784), a set of PE/PPE genes (Rv1787-Rv1792) and the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 family proteins (esxM and esxN) [37] . ESX-5 is absent from the genome of the fast-growing, non-pathogenic M. smegmatis, but present in both the M. avium complex and M. marinum. The role of ESX-5 in virulence has been demonstrated in M. marinum [37, 42] . It has been suggested that the ESX clusters evolved via gene duplication [43] and DU-Tice offers the first snapshot of such an event.\\nTo our knowledge, we have conducted the first genomic analysis of BCG-China, which is a descendant of BCG-Danish obtained from the Statens Serum Institut around 1947. Consistently, BCG-China exhibits the DU2-III duplication and deletion of RD2 (data not shown), which is similar to other BCG-Danish derivatives, including BCG-Prague (obtained in 1946 from passage 725) [44] , \\nThe coordinates correspond to the genome of M. tb H37Rv. The two deletions and DU-Tice were confirmed by PCR application and DNA sequencing.\\nNovel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array Figure 1 Novel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array. Sections of the ratio plot are shown. The ratio of the reference (M. tb H37Rv) probe intensity (Cy5) was divided by the test (BCG strain) probe intensity (Cy3). Reference probes and test probes that do not span a mutation should represent full-length perfect match hybridization, and thus should have similar intensities, with a reference/test ratio near 1. If the test genome contains an amplification event (increased copy number when compared to the reference), then the reference/test ratio will shift below 1. (A) Novel duplication (DU-Birkhaug) identified in BCG-Birkhaug, which is analogous to the DU-Pasteur (DU1) but has different borders. The same genomic region of BCG-Sweden, which is closely related to BCG-Birkhaug, is shown for comparison. (B) Novel duplication (DU-Tice) identified in BCG-Tice. Three other BCG strains belonging to the same group (DU2-IV) are shown for comparison. (C) The precise border of DU-Tice is mapped by PCR amplification using primers specific to the junction. The two copies are immediately adjacent to each other and overlap by 1 bp.\\nBCG-Glaxo (obtained in 1954, from passage 1077) and BCG-Danish (lyophilized in 1961, from passage 1331) [45] . However, BCG-China and -Prague do not contain the previously described deletion of Rv1810, which is characteristic of BCG-Glaxo and -Danish. As such, the Rv1810 deletion must have occurred between 1947 and 1954. Coincidentally, this period corresponds to the replacement of potato bile medium by Sauton medium for BCG production in Denmark [12] .\\nThe PhoP-PhoR system is one of the 11 two-component systems found in the M. tb genome [29] . The PhoR protein is a transmembrane histidine kinase that transmits signals from the environment by autophosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to PhoP, a response regulator that regulates the expression of multiple genes [46] . Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the PhoP-PhoR system, particularly PhoP, plays an essential role in M. tb virulence [26, [46] [47] [48] . A single point mutation (S219L) in the DNA binding region of PhoP partially accounts for the attenuation of the H37Ra strain of M. tb [26] . Furthermore, a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice infections [47] . Our NimbleGen analysis revealed some weak signals in the phoP-phoR region (not shown), which prompted us to resequence these genes. The DNA fragment containing the promoter region of phoP, the ORFs of phoP and phoR, and the intergenic region was PCR amplified from each BCG strain and determined by DNA sequencing.\\nOur sequence analysis revealed a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains compared to the genome sequence of M. bovis. The three early BCG substrains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, contain an identical IS6110 (1,356 bp) insertion at nucleotide 851593 of the M. tb genome, which is 18 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP (Fig. 2) . This IS6110 element is identical to many other copies of IS6110 found in various locations in the M. tb genome. It is flanked by a 3-bp direct repeat (GAA) on both sides and is in an inverse orientation of phoP-phoR (Fig. 2) . The presence of an IS6110 element in the promoter region of phoP in BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau has been described previously, but its insertion site and orientation were not determined until now [49] . Although not present in M. tb H37Rv or M. bovis AF2122/97, an IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter was found in a clinical strain of M. bovis termed B strain, which was responsible for a severe nosocomial outbreak of multidrug resistant TB in humans in Spain [50, 51] . However, unlike the three BCG strains, the IS6110 insertion in the M. bovis B strain is located at 75 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP and is in the same orientation as phoP-phoR [50] . The potential effect of IS6110\\nIS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter in BCG-Russia, -Moreau, and -Japan on phoP expression is described in the \\'Discussion\\' section.\\nThree other novel phoP-phoR polymorphisms that likely impact their functions were also uncovered by our sequencing analysis. An identical, 11-bp deletion within the ORF of phoR was uncovered in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (ACCGGACTGGG, nucleotides from 853689 to 853699, M. tb genome coordinates). This deletion changes the amino acid sequence of 54 residues (residues 432 to 485) in the C-terminal of PhoR. This polymorphism is different than the previously described 10 bp deletion within phoR present in BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, which affects residues 91-485 [24] . BCG-Frappier also contains a single nucleotide deletion (A at 852701, M. tb genome coordinates), causing a frame-shift mutation that affect residues 103-485 of PhoR. Together, these results indicate that besides BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, BCG-Sweden, -Birkhaug, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene.\\nA single nucleotide insertion within the ORF of phoP was uncovered in BCG-Prague (G, between nucleotides 852067 and 852068, M. tb genome coordinates) [see Additional file 2]. This frame shift mutation changes the C-terminal sequence (residues 154-247) of PhoP, which is the DNA binding domain (residues 144-247) [52] [53] [54] .\\nAs such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant.\\nSingle point mutations in PhoP or PhoR are also found in various BCG strains and are summarized in Table 2 . In contrast, sequences of the phoP-phoR locus of BCG-Phipps, -Tice, and -Pasteur are identical to the published sequence of BCG-Pasteur and M. bovis [24, 30] .\\nThe loss of the RD1-encoded ESX-1 protein secretion system during 1908-1921 contributes to the attenuation of BCG ( [55] , see also Fig. 3) . However, because reintroduction of ESX-1 into BCG does not restore full virulence, other genetic lesions are also involved [56] . As such, some strains are more virulent than others in animal models of infection [57] and also exhibit differential ability to induce adverse reactions (reactogenicity) following vaccination in neonates [58] . Our current work begins to provide some explanation for these observed differences (Fig. 3) .\\nConsistent with a previous study [58] , we find that the earliest distributed BCG strains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, all contain a second copy of IS6110 that is inserted in the promoter region of phoP. A similar, albeit distinct, insertion of IS6110 in the phoP promoter was also found in a virulent strain called M. bovis B strain [50] . The presence of IS6110, which is in the same orientation as phoP, increases the expression of phoP and (the resulting [30] . BCG-Danish and -Glaxo contains a 10 bp deletion within phoR, which was described previously [24] . ND: polymorphisms not detected. NA: no affect.\\nincrease in virulence) was thought to be responsible for the outbreak of M. bovis B strain in humans [50] . Similarly, the expression level of phoP was found to be higher in BCG-Japan than in BCG-Pasteur [24] . However, in BCG-Japan, -Russia, and -Moreau, the IS6110 is in the inverse orientation of phoP (Fig. 2 ). As such, how IS6110 upregulates phoP expression in BCG is not immediately apparent and likely involves a different mechanism. One possibility is the elimination of phoP autoregulation. It was shown that PhoP protein, albeit from H37Ra, binds to three 9-bp direct repeats within the phoP promoter sequence and represses its own expression [52] . In BCG, IS6110 is inserted between the PhoP binding sites and the start codon of phoP, which could impair the repression by PhoP and subsequently increase phoP expression. Alternatively, an unidentified promoter sequence within IS6110 in the same orientation of phoP could drive the expression of phoP. The presence of the second copy of IS6110 in these early BCG strains also suggests that the original BCG isolated in 1921 might have been derived from a highly virulent M. bovis strain containing the same IS6110 element. This IS6110 was subsequently lost in other BCG strains (Fig. 3) and is not present in most clinical strains of M. bovis and M. tb isolated in modern times [50, 59] .\\nGiven the important role of PhoP in M. tb virulence, higher expression of phoP could explain why BCG-Russia is generally considered more virulent than other BCG strains [6] . However, in the other early strains, BCG-Moreau and BCG-Japan, the loss of lipid virulence factors PDIMs and PGLs appears to have a more pronounced effect on virulence. Consequently, these two strains, together with BCG-Glaxo, which also lacks PDIMs and PGLs, and as we have described previously, are more attenuated and less reactogenic than other BCG strains [35] . The deletion of fadD26-ppsA described here provides a genetic mechanism for the defective PDIM/PGL biosynthesis in BCG-Moreau. However, this region is intact in BCG-Japan and BCG-Glaxo, indicating that other mechanisms may also lead to the PDIM/PGL defect.\\nBCG-Sweden was obtained from the Institut Pasteur in 1926 while Konrad Birkhaug acquired the strain that bears his name around 1927 [6] . Previous studies indicated that these strains differ from other early BCG strains (i.e., BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau) only by the loss of the IS6110 element described above. Our current work reveals three novel deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (Fig. 3) , which distinguish them from other early strains. Two deletions affect the regulatory proteins WhiB3 and TrcR, and have different impacts on virulence.\\nThe whiB3 gene appears to be important for virulence. The M. bovis whiB3 mutant is attenuated for growth in guinea pigs but not in mice [40] . Conversely, the trcRS two-component system has a negative impact on virulence. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype in SCID mice [41] . BCG-Sweden was used in Sweden from 1926 until 1978 and was then replaced by BCG-Danish because of the high frequency of osteitis associated with the former strain [60] . The deletion of trcR may contribute to the reactogenicity of BCG-Sweden. Figure 3 Refined genealogy of BCG vaccines. The genealogy is modified from a previous model [24] . Genetic markers identified in this work are highlighted.\\nThe other deletion found in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug affects the phoR gene of the phoP-phoR two-component system. Remarkably, three other late BCG strains, BCG-Danish, -Glaxo, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene. Together a total of five BCG strains are natural phoR mutants. However, three distinct mutations are found among these five strains, which correspond to their genealogy (Fig. 3) . The role of phoR in virulence is less understood than for phoP. Among its many functions, phoP is required for the biosynthesis of trehalose-containing cell wall lipids [48, 61, 62] . Contrastingly, phoR does not seem to be required for this function [62] . Nevertheless, the fact that the phoR mutation has been acquired by different groups of BCG strains by three independent events and genetic mechanisms suggests that there was a common selective pressure and an important role for this gene during the in vitro evolution of BCG.\\nAnother BCG strain that contains a major mutation in the phoP-phoR system is BCG-Prague. A single nucleotide insertion in the ORF of phoP changes the C-terminal sequence, which contains the DNA binding domain of PhoP [52] [53] [54] . As such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant and likely to be more attenuated than other BCG strains. This is consistent with the study by Lagranderie et al., which showed in mice models of infection that BCG-Prague exhibited more attenuated phenotypes compared to three other BCG strains (BCG-Russia, -Pasteur, and -Glaxo) [57] . Compared to 11 other BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Moreau, -Japan, -Sweden, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Pasteur that have been analyzed in the current study, BCG-Prague consistently exhibited the weakest ability to induce delayed type hypersensitivity to tuberculin in children [63] or in guinea pig models [64] . Because of the traditional presumption that tuberculin reactivity is associated with vaccine potency, BCG-Prague, which was used in Czechoslovakia between 1951-1980 and appeared to be effective, was replaced by BCG-Russia in 1981 [58] . An immediate increase of BCG-induced osteitis cases was observed in Czechoslovakia following the switch of BCG-Prague to BCG-Russia [65] . The phoP mutation detected in the current study may explain the weak tuberculin sensitivity induced by BCG-Prague. It was recently shown that a phoP mutant of M. tb was more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur and confers an equivalent protection in mice against M. tb challenge. In the guinea pig model, the M. tb phoP mutant showed superior protection to BCG-Pasteur against a high dose challenge with M. tb [47] . Consequently, the M. tb phoP mutant is now being evaluated as a vaccine candidate to replace BCG [66] . Since BCG-Pasteur contains an intact phoP gene, and in light of our finding, it would be worthy to compare the M. tb phoP mutant with BCG-Prague in terms of safety and protective efficacy.\\nThe novel duplication uncovered in BCG-Tice (DU-Tice) may have an impact on its residual virulence and immunogenicity. DU-Tice contains the entire ESX-5 secretion system, which is one of the five type VII secretion systems found in the M. tb complex [37] . Importantly, besides the RD1-encoded ESX-1, ESX-5 is the only other ESX system that has been shown to be involved in virulence thus far [37] . ESX-5 is conserved in other pathogenic mycobacteria and reported to facilitate the cell-to-cell spread of M. marinum in infected macrophages, a function shared by ESX-1 [42] . However, ESX-5 does not complement the loss of virulence caused by ESX-1 deletion, suggesting that they play distinct roles in virulence [37] . Horwitz and co-workers have used BCG-Tice as the host strain to overexpress antigen 85B. This resulted in a recombinant strain termed rBCG30 that exhibits superior protective efficacy over BCG-Tice and is currently being evaluated as a vaccine candidate in human clinical trials [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . The rBCG30 Tice strain also showed significantly stronger immune response and better protection against M. tb challenge than the rBCG30 strain based on BCG-Connaught [69] .\\nThe duplication of ESX-5 in BCG-Tice, which could increase the residual virulence and immunogenicity, may partially account for the benefit associated with rBCG30 Tice.\\nOur current work has uncovered six large sequence polymorphisms not described previously, including two deletions exclusive to BCG-Moreau, two deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug, as well as the DU-Birkhaug and DU-Tice duplications. Moreover, we have uncovered a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains. Remarkably, these polymorphisms affect genes that are well known to have major impact on the virulence of M. tb or M. bovis. These include genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid virulence factors PDIMs/PGLs, genes that encode the ESX family type VII secretion system, and the phoP-phoR two-component regulatory system. [72] . In addition, a mutant of M. bovis deficient in PDIMs/PGLs is being considered as a vaccine to protect wildlife against bovine tuberculosis [73] . Our previous study [35] and current work provide direct evidence that BCG vaccine strains are different in major virulence factors, and likely have different vaccination properties including safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Since new vaccine candidates are evaluated for their vaccination properties relative to BCG, the appropriate choice of BCG strain for these studies is critical. Furthermore, because it is likely that BCG will continue to play a role in tuberculosis control by being included in forthcoming clinical trials, as either a primer to be boosted by new components (e.g. subunit or DNA vaccine) or as an integral component (e.g. recombinant BCG) of new vaccines, greater attention must be given to the benefits that a particular strain may -or may notoffer.\\nThe mycobacterial strains used in this study were: \\nMutation mapping microarrays were designed with Nim-bleGen algorithms that select a 29-mer oligonucleotide every 7 bases on each strand of the reference genome sequence (Genbank Accession AL123456) [29] . All probes were synthesized in parallel on a four-array set using a Digital Light Processor™ (Texas Instruments, Plano Texas) and photoprotected by phosphoramidite chemis-try (Maskless Array Synthesis) (NimbleGen Systems, Madison WI) in a random probe layout [74, 75] .\\nLabeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer at 42°C for 16 hr using a MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah). Labeled genomic DNA (5 μg) from the reference strain M. tb H37Rv and from each BCG strain were co-hybridized to each array. Arrays were washed with NimbleGen wash buffer, and were then spun dry in a microarray high-speed centrifuge (TeleChem International, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and stored until scanned.\\nMicroarrays were scanned at 5 μm resolution using the Genepix ® 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City CA), and pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleS-can™ v2.4 software (NimbleGen). Probes that spanned potential mutations were identified by NimbleGen software. Probe sequences corresponding to all possible candidate mutation sites were selected for resequencing. The strategy that was used to automatically generate the sequencing array is similar to that described previously [28] . Briefly, 8 probes per base position were analyzed, 4 per genome strand. These probes contain all possible alleles at a centrally located position. The length, melting temperature and mismatch position of each probe were optimized. When target DNA is hybridized to these arrays the perfectly matched probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatched probes for each strand. The differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely. These resequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each BCG strain and scanned as above. Sequence base assignments were made using a machinelearning algorithm [76] .

There are systemic and local treatments for the disease. However, the use of systemic therapy with antihistamines and corticosteroids is associated with adverse effects. It has been reported that dapsone or sulfamethoxazole has a certain curative effect, but patients often relapse and experience toxic side effects. 4 In a previous study, the papules and pruritus in some patients subsided rapidly after treatment with minocycline, and there was no recurrence about one year after the discontinuation of treatment. 5, 6 This case presents a 20-year-old female patient with PP treated with oral minocycline. PP is a rare disease, and this case report demonstrates an effective treatment that can provide first-hand clinical data for clinicians.\\nA 20-year-old female patient presented with erythema and blisters on the neck and trunk with pruritus for 20 days. On 5 July 2020, without an obvious cause, the patient developed edematous erythema with pruritus at the hairline of the posterior neck and then purchased a natural Chinese herbal remedy (Pifuyihao Cream, Jimingtang Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Jangxi, China) for topical application. After application, the edema was relieved, but erythema and secondary pigmentation were still present. About 1 week later, the patient developed erythema and blisters with pruritus on the chest and back, and no significant effect of the continuous application of \"PIFUYIHAO\" was observed. The lesions continued to expand, and erythema and blisters with severe pruritus also appeared on the waist and abdomen. On 26 July 2020, the patient visited our clinic. The patient was unmarried and nulliparous, previously healthy, had stable weight before onset, denied food, drug and contact allergies and denied a family history of allergic, metabolic and endocrine system diseases.\\nPhysical examination showed a good general condition, no palpable enlargement of systemic superficial lymph nodes and no abnormalities on systemic examination. Dermatological examination revealed a reticular distribution of dark red patches under the patient\\'s breast with adherent scales. On the abdomen, multiple blisters of different sizes with clear blister fluid and negative Nikolsky\\'s sign were noted, and some blisters were present on areas of erythema. On the neck and back, there was a large area of erythema with a reticular distribution, a few scales and scattered scratches and crusts ( Figure 1a and Figure 1b ). The patient was finally diagnosed with PP and administered 100 mg oral minocycline once daily. After 10 days of treatment, the primary rash subsided, and pruritus was relieved, leaving pigmented patches ( Figure 1c and Figure 1d ). The medication was then stopped with subsequent observation for 6 months, and no side effects have been observed.\\nIn addition, laboratory and auxiliary examinations showed the following results: anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibody (-), antinuclear antibody (-), anti-double stranded DNA antibody (-), antidesmoglein 1 (Dsg1) (-), anti-Dsg3 (-) and bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 (-). The results of urine and stool routine tests and biochemical tests revealed no abnormalities. Furthermore, the treponema pallidum particle agglutination, anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody, hepatitis B antibody and hepatitis C antibody assays were also normal. In addition, histopathological analysis of the lesions showed hyperkeratosis and intraepidermal multilocular vesiculation and confirmed increased inflammatory cell migration into the epidermis and infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils, in the superficial dermis (Figure 2a and Figure 2b ). The expression levels of IgG, IgM, IgA and C3 were all negative, and the results of the direct immunofluorescence assay were negative.\\nPP, also known as Nagashima disease, is a rare inflammatory skin disease of an unknown etiology. This disease mainly occurs in adolescents and young adults and is more common in women. The mean age of onset is 24.4 years, with 84.3% of cases occurring between 11 and 30 years old. It predominately affects the back, chest, neck and face. PP tends to recur in spring and summer and is mainly limited to the original pigmented area. 7 The clinical symptoms of this disease occur in stages. 8 The early symptoms include sudden onset of erythema with pruritus and edema, maculopapular rashes and papules. The symptoms in the mature stage include erythema, papules, blisters and crust formation. The main symptom in the late stage is a reticular and patchy pigmented rash with a smooth surface. The changes in the histopathology of this disease are also staged. 9 In the early stage, the histopathology shows hyperkeratosis, interspinous spongiosis, a small number of necrotic keratinocytes, papillary dermal edema and neutrophil infiltration around superficial vessels. Neutrophils may form microabscesses in the epidermis, typically in the upper part of the basal layer of the epidermis, and adhere to edematous or necrotic keratinocytes in a clumped or single-cell manner. This feature is highly specific for PP. In the mature stage, lymphocytes predominate in dermal infiltrates and may be accompanied by neutrophils and eosinophils. Additionally, more obvious spongiosis is observed in the epidermis, leading to intraepidermal or subepidermal vesiculation and even overall necrosis. The late stage is characterized by hyperkeratosis, sparse perivascular lymphocyte infiltration around the vessels and pigment incontinence and melanophages in the papillary dermis. A single rash varies in duration from 2 days to several weeks, ranges in reticular distribution from local to enlarged and causes reticular post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. 10 Lesions at different stages often coexist and combine to form a reticular configuration. 11, 12 The analysis of clinical symptoms and histopathology is required for the diagnosis of PP. In this case, the patient was a young woman with clinical manifestations of erythema, blisters and reticular pigmentation after relapse, consistent with the manifestations and histopathology of PP. Her clinical manifestations were erythema and blisters on the chest and back. Pathological analysis revealed multilocular blisters in the epidermis. Neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes had infiltrated the blisters. The diagnosis was consistent with bullous PP.\\nBecause of to the diversity of rash morphologies, the differential diagnosis of PP is extensive. 13 It needs to be differentiated from contact dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris and urticaria in the early stage; erythema multiforme and pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta in the mature stage; and confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CARP) and poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans in the late stage. In particular, owing to a similar reticulated configuration, it is often difficult to differentiate between PP and CARP. CARP is also a rare skin disease with an unknown etiology, more commonly occurring in adolescents and women. 14 Similar to PP, the lesions of CARP often begin in the intermammary and mid-dorsal regions and may involve the back, neck and trunk. However, in contrast to PP, CARP usually has no subjective symptoms, with occasional pruritus and slow disease development. 15 CARP is clinically characterized by the accumulation of squamous or verrucous papules that are confluent in the center and reticulated at the periphery. In this case, patients present with clinically obvious intraepidermal blisters, but this condition also needs to be differentiated from pemphigus and other intraepidermal bullous diseases. Both can present as intraepidermal blisters, but the latter occurs in middle-aged and elderly patients, often involving the skin and mucosa. 16 Histopathological analysis shows the loss of adhesion between keratinocytes (acantholysis), immunopathological findings in skin lesions and blood circulation of IgG antibodiesy. Hyperkeratosis, papillomatous hyperplasia, acanthosis, increased basal pigmentation, dermal edema and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration are also observed. Minocycline, imidazoles or retinoids are effective in some CARP cases. 17 The pathogenesis of PP is unknown but may involve neutrophil-mediated inflammation. 18 In addition, mechanical irritation or contact allergies to nickel, chromium and/or climate may also contribute to the development of PP. 11 PP has been demonstrated to be associated with several systemic diseases, including adult Still\\'s disease, 19 atopic dermatitis, 20 Helicobacter pylori infection 21, 22 and Sj€ ogren\\'s syndrome. 23 PP has also been reported in patients with less food intake because of fasting and diet, 24,25 anorexia, 26 type 2 diabetes, 27 bariatric surgery, 28, 29 gastric surgery 30 and early pregnancy. 31 Researchers 29, 32 have speculated that dietary factors lead to the involvement of ketone-induced neutrophilmediated inflammation in the occurrence of PP and confirmed increased ketone levels in the urine and/or blood in some patients.\\nPP usually improves after treatment with oral minocycline, doxycycline or dapsone, which is considered to be related to antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, such as the inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis. 12 However, hyperpigmentation tends to persist even after regression of the rash.\\nJY admitted the patient and provided her treatment plans, SJ treated the patient, and MZ performed the pathological tests.\\nThis study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of The Fifth People\\'s Hospital of HaiNan Province, China (approval no.: 165). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for their anonymized information to be published in this study.\\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.', 'In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic [1] . The high transmissibility of the virus and clinical severity of the associated coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have since challenged most aspects of healthcare delivery globally. This includes diagnosis, clinical management, and infection prevention and control measures related to COVID-19, but also the effective delivery of antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in early 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic [2] .\\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, total antibacterial consumption in England had been decreasing, mainly driven by reduced prescribing in primary care [3] . The decrease followed national awareness campaigns, changes in prescribing guidelines, and National Health Service (NHS) quality improvement and assurance schemes, all aimed at reducing prescribing in both primary and secondary care [3] [4] [5] [6] . Changes in antibacterial prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic were anticipated given that clinical features of the severe respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those caused by bacteria. Moreover, markers of infection such as C-reactive protein did not effectively distinguish between bacterial and viral pneumonia infections. Such diagnostic challenges complicated the decision for clinicians as to whether to prescribe antibiotics empirically [7] .\\nIn addition, other serious viral respiratory infections such as influenza are often complicated by bacterial and/or fungal co-or secondary infections [8, 9] . Worldwide, the prevalence of co-infections in COVID-19 patients varies widely, from 0% to 46% in early studies [10] , and the bacterial prevalence of both co/secondary infections was estimated to be 6.9% [11] . In England, co/secondary bacterial/fungal infections were infrequent (1%) among COVID-19 patients [12] .\\nThe International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium reported that of 264,496 COVID-19 patients across 54 countries, 80% received antibiotics and 15% received antivirals. For patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), an even higher percentage received antibiotics (93% of 24,822 patients) and antivirals (34% of 24,274 patients) [13] . In a rapid review, the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing among COVID-19 patients was 75%, with mechanical ventilation and older age associated with higher prescribing in COVID-19 patients [14] . Other studies have also shown high levels of empirical antibiotic treatment for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic [15, 16] . In primary care, a study from Scotland showed that the total number of prescriptions used for respiratory infections fell at the beginning of the pandemic [17] .\\nTo raise awareness of prudent antimicrobial use and guiding principles of antimicrobial stewardship, the WHO published interim guidance on the clinical management of COVID-19 in May 2020 [18] . It does not recommend antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis for patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 but advised empiric antibiotic treatment for patients with severe COVID-19, based on clinical judgement along with assessments for de-escalation.\\nIn England, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) developed rapid clinical guidelines for COVID-19 including management of pneumonia (community and hospital) [7, 19] . Across the UK, a third of organisations updated their local guidelines on community and hospital-acquired pneumonia based on the NICE national guidelines published in April 2020. Hospitals also reported a reduction in routine antimicrobial stewardship activities, with 64% reporting that COVID-19 had a negative impact on stewardship activities [20] .\\nConcerns were raised that the COVID-19 pandemic would challenge the recent gains in prudent antibacterial use that protect patients from harm, such as Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) following antibiotic treatment, and combat antimicrobial resistance [21, 22] . We aim to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antibacterial prescribing across primary and secondary care in England between January and October 2020, to inform antimicrobial stewardship activities during the ongoing COVID-19 challenges and future pandemic preparations.\\nIn England, total antibacterial prescribing in the community had been falling (by 0.3% per month; 95% confidence interval CI: −0.4 to −0.3, p < 0.05) prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, it decreased by an additional 1.4% per month (95% CI: −2.3 to −0.5, p < 0.05). However, there was a slight increase in prescribing (by 1.5 items/1000 population) seen in March 2020 compared to March 2019 ( Figure 1a ).\\nAntibiotics 2021, 10, 841 3 of 13 observed in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (by 20.6%) (Figure 1b) . However, the increase in broad-spectrum items prescriptions during COVID-19 was not statistically significant (p = 0.111). This increase was mainly seen in April 2020 ( Figure S1 ), with the increase from March to April 2020 (by 0.2 items/1000 population) mainly driven by the rise of co-amoxiclav, followed by cephalosporins; particularly first-generation cephalosporins (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 ). Antibacterials used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) increased by 9.3% (2.2 items/1000 population) in March 2020 compared to March 2019 (Figure S2 ), although the increase in CAP prescriptions during COVID-19 overall was not statistically significant (p = 0.893). Specifically, prescriptions of oral amoxicillin and doxycycline increased by 4.1% and 28.9% (0.5 and 1.3 items/1000 population), respectively, in March 2020, compared to the same month in 2019. Amoxicillin prescriptions decreased sharply from March to May 2020 by 59.9% and remained low in the summer months. In contrast, there was a slight increase in doxycycline use in April 2020 compared to April 2019 ( Figure S3 ).\\nPrescriptions for which the age is unknown have decreased since becoming available in April 2015, from 7.3% to 1.1% in October 2020. Overall, total prescriptions for children (in the 0-4 and 5-14 age group) decreased during COVID-19 but the decreases were not statistically significant (p = 0.305 and 0.051, respectively). Most age groups saw a small increase in the number of total antibacterial items prescribed in March 2020 compared to March 2019, except for children below the age of 15. The slight increase seen in March 2020 was also observed for CAP prescriptions ( Figure S4 ).\\nThe rise in prescriptions in March 2020 compared to March 2019 was seen especially in older adults aged between 60 to 74, and over 75 ( Use of broad-spectrum antibacterials (co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones) in terms of items and as a percentage of total use in the community has also been decreasing since 2015. However, the percentage of broad-spectrum antibacterials over total prescriptions has changed to an upward trend during the pandemic with an increase of 0.2% per month (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.3, p < 0.05), as opposed to decreasing by 0.04% per month (95% CI: −0.04 to −0.03, p < 0.05) pre-COVID. The largest percentage increase was observed in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (by 20.6%) (Figure 1b) . However, the increase in broad-spectrum items prescriptions during COVID-19 was not statistically significant (p = 0.111). This increase was mainly seen in April 2020 ( Figure S1 ), with the increase from March to April 2020 (by 0.2 items/1000 population) mainly driven by the rise of co-amoxiclav, followed by cephalosporins; particularly first-generation cephalosporins (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).\\nAntibacterials used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) increased by 9.3% (2.2 items/1000 population) in March 2020 compared to March 2019 ( Figure S2 ), although the increase in CAP prescriptions during COVID-19 overall was not statistically significant (p = 0.893).

Amoxicillin prescriptions decreased sharply from March to May 2020 by 59.9% and remained low in the summer months. In contrast, there was a slight increase in doxycycline use in April 2020 compared to April 2019 ( Figure S3 ).\\nPrescriptions for which the age is unknown have decreased since becoming available in April 2015, from 7.3% to 1.1% in October 2020. Overall, total prescriptions for children (in the 0-4 and 5-14 age group) decreased during COVID-19 but the decreases were not statistically significant (p = 0.305 and 0.051, respectively). Most age groups saw a small increase in the number of total antibacterial items prescribed in March 2020 compared to March 2019, except for children below the age of 15. The slight increase seen in March 2020 was also observed for CAP prescriptions ( Figure S4 ).\\nThe rise in prescriptions in March 2020 compared to March 2019 was seen especially in older adults aged between 60 to 74, and over 75 ( Figure 2 ). Prescriptions for broadspectrum items in older adults over the age of 75 saw an increase in April 2020 compared to April 2019 ( Figure S5 ). Specifically, a large rise was seen in co-amoxiclav prescribing for this age group between March and April 2020 by 24.8% ( Figure S6 ). to April 2019 ( Figure S5 ). Specifically, a large rise was seen in co-amoxiclav prescribing for this age group between March and April 2020 by 24.8% ( Figure S6 ). In contrast, for infants and children up to four years, total prescriptions decreased sharply from March 2020 (−50.3% from March to April 2020) and remained low in the summer months ( Figure 2 ). This age group had the largest decreasing trend in total prescriptions post-COVID-19 (by -6.1% per month, 95% CI: −8.1 to −4.1, p < 0.05). CAP prescriptions for infants and young children saw a large decrease between March and April 2020 ( Figure S4 ), specifically amoxicillin prescriptions (−62.5%) ( Figure S7 ). \\nIn secondary care, the rate of total antibacterial consumption measured in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)/1000 hospital admissions had been increasing year-on-year prior to COVID-19 (an increase of 0.2% per month, 95% CI: 0.09% to 0.3%, p < 0.05). During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of total antibacterial use measured in DDDs has decreased to its lowest since 2015 ( Figure 3a ). The fall in total DDDs during COVID-19 overall was statistically significant (−12.1% compared to before COVID-19, 95% CI: −19.1 to −4.4, p < 0.05). However, when measuring total usage as the rate of antibacterial use per hospital admission, this increased overall during COVID-19 compared to before COVID-19 (by 12.0%, 95% CI: 2.6% to 22.3%, p < 0.05). Particularly, the rate doubled in April 2020 compared to April 2019 (7228 vs. 4681 DDDs/1000 admissions) and only returned to levels more in line with previous years from July 2020 onwards ( Figure 3b ).\\nThe rate of antibacterials used for treatment of CAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in hospitals per 1000 admissions followed a similar trend to the rate of total antibacterial usage in hospitals -both saw overall increases during COVID-19 (p < 0.05) with a peak in usage seen in April 2020 ( Figure 4 ). In contrast, for infants and children up to four years, total prescriptions decreased sharply from March 2020 (−50.3% from March to April 2020) and remained low in the summer months ( Figure 2 ). This age group had the largest decreasing trend in total prescriptions post-COVID-19 (by −6.1% per month, 95% CI: −8.1 to −4.1, p < 0.05).

Although the use of doxycycline in the \\'Access\\' group saw an increase of 59.5% in April 2020 compared to April 2019 ( Figure S8 ), the percentage of all \\'Access\\' antibacterial use decreased in April 2020 to 43.3% from 48.6% in April 2019. However, the decreasing trend in the percentage of \\'Access\\' use during the pandemic was not statistically significant (p = 0.156). Usage of \\'Access\\' antimicrobials then increased to 48.5% in August 2020, similar to pre-pandemic levels (Table S3) . Conversely, the percentage of \\'Watch\\' and \\'Reserve\\' antibacterial use increased during COVID-19, especially in April 2020. The increasing trends of the percentage of \\'Watch\\' and \\'Reserve\\' use during COVID-19 were not statistically significant (p = 0.374 and 0.373, respectively), and the percentage use for both The rate of antibacterials used for treatment of CAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in hospitals per 1000 admissions followed a similar trend to the rate of total antibacterial usage in hospitals-both saw overall increases during COVID-19 (p < 0.05) with a peak in usage seen in April 2020 ( Figure 4 ). Although the use of doxycycline in the \\'Access\\' group saw an increase of 59.5% in April 2020 compared to April 2019 ( Figure S8 ), the percentage of all \\'Access\\' antibacterial use decreased in April 2020 to 43.3% from 48.6% in April 2019.

The increasing trends of the percentage of \\'Watch\\' and \\'Reserve\\' use during COVID-19 were not statistically significant (p = 0.374 and 0.373, respectively), and the percentage use for both then decreased to similar levels observed prior to the peak of the first wave in July and August ( Figure 5 ). then decreased to similar levels observed prior to the peak of the first wave in July and August ( Figure 5 ). The rise in use of \\'Watch\\' category antibacterials was mainly due to the increased use of co-amoxiclav, third-generation cephalosporins (specifically ceftriaxone), and macrolides ( Figure S9 and S10). The rise in macrolide usage was mainly driven by clarithromycin, with small increases seen in azithromycin and erythromycin ( Figure S10 ). The rate of piperacillin/tazobactam use within the \\'Watch\\' category increased by 82.8% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. This baseline level is historically low following a global shortage in 2017 ( Figure S11 ). The rise in the percentage of \\'Reserve\\' category antibiotics by 0.2 percentage points in April 2020 in comparison to April 2019 was predominantly due to a 79.5% increase in the use of carbapenems ( Figure S12 ).\\nThis study is the first to describe national antibacterial use in both primary and secondary care during the COVID-19 pandemic between January and October 2020. In England, total antibacterial use measured in items and DDDs in primary and secondary care, respectively, reduced overall during the first wave of the pandemic. However, the rate of antibacterial usage by hospital admission increased steeply in March and April 2020, despite low rates of bacterial co-infections being reported for COVID-19 patients [10, 11, 23] . This likely reflects unfamiliarity with treating a new pathogen, and uncertainties around bacterial co-infection and secondary infection at the time. Moreover, the rate of total prescribing in the community was lower than in previous years from April to October 2020, also seen at the beginning of the pandemic in British Columbia, Canada [24] . This probably reflects changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour, access to healthcare, and reduced transmission of other infectious pathogens due to the adoption of population-level measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community (\\'lockdown\\') [25] .\\nIn the community, total and broad-spectrum prescribing has been falling since 2014 following the introduction of NHS quality improvement initiatives and awareness campaigns [3, 26, 27] .

The rise in macrolide usage was mainly driven by clarithromycin, with small increases seen in azithromycin and erythromycin ( Figure S10 ). The rate of piperacillin/tazobactam use within the \\'Watch\\' category increased by 82.8% in April 2020 compared to April 2019.

This probably reflects changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour, access to healthcare, and reduced transmission of other infectious pathogens due to the adoption of population-level measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community (\\'lockdown\\') [25] .\\nIn the community, total and broad-spectrum prescribing has been falling since 2014 following the introduction of NHS quality improvement initiatives and awareness cam-paigns [3, 26, 27] . However, from April 2020 onwards the percentage of total items comprised of broad-spectrum antibacterials increased. This is partly due to the large decrease in prescriptions of the narrow-spectrum amoxicillin for infants and young children. During the same time period, respiratory tract infections also decreased significantly, likely due to reduced mixing of children from the closure of schools and early years settings during the community lockdown [28] .\\nWith COVID-19 changing much of prescribing practice and healthcare-seeking behaviour by patients, comparisons of percentages of total prescriptions should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, a small rise in the number of broad-spectrum antibacterial items was seen in April 2020 compared to April 2019, particularly in older adults over the age of 75, driven by co-amoxiclav prescribing in this age group. The co-amoxiclav increase seen in older patients was also observed in North West London [29] . This may reflect treatment of other primary infections, such as urinary tract infections, to avoid hospital admission during the pandemic, further work is required to evidence whether the antibacterial use was appropriate. The use of certain broad-spectrum antibacterials, particularly cephalosporins and quinolones, is associated with increased risks of CDI and should be reserved for treating resistant infections [22] . Although the count of CDI in April to June 2020 decreased compared to the same period in the previous year, reported community-onset, community-associated CDI increased slightly [30] . Further investigations are needed to understand the large reduction of antibacterial use in the community and its impacts on infections.\\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more antibacterial items for respiratory infections were prescribed in primary care in England in March 2020 when compared to March 2019. This was also seen in Scotland [17] and is thought to be due to additional prescribing of \\'just in case\\' rescue antibiotic packs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients at risk of severe respiratory disease. Oral amoxicillin and oral doxycycline were recommended as first-choice treatments in the pre-COVID NICE community-acquired pneumonia guideline [31] , and the usage of both antibacterials increased in March 2020 compared to March 2019. Both antibiotics were commonly prescribed within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in North West London [29] . While amoxicillin use saw a sharp decrease from March to May 2020, doxycycline use increased slightly in April 2020 compared to April 2019 when the COVID-19 rapid guideline was published, as doxycycline was recommended over amoxicillin due to the broader spectrum of cover against secondary bacterial causes of pneumonia [19] .\\nThe reduction in antibiotic items prescribed in the community may be related to \\'lockdown\\' and the fall in general practice (GP) attendance (face-to-face, virtual and telephone included) in March 2020 in England [32] . The majority of antibacterial prescribing in primary care is for respiratory or urinary tract infections [33] and the consultation rates of both infections have decreased in the UK during the pandemic [34] . There was also a change in GP appointment mode from a majority of face-to face to telephone/virtual appointments [32] . The high percentage of broad-spectrum prescribing from total items in both in-hours and out-of-hours GP, especially for co-amoxiclav and doxycycline in outof-hours between March and May 2020 [35] , may reflect higher levels of \"precautionary\" antibacterial prescribing in remote consultations compared to in-person appointments.\\nIn hospitals, the total volume of antibacterial use measured in DDDs fell sharply in April 2020 and remains lower than levels seen in the preceding five years. However, the rate of prescribing measured in DDDs/1000 admissions increased sharply in April 2020, only returning in July 2020 to similar levels seen in previous years. This is likely to be due to hospitals implementing rapid changes in healthcare service provision such as cancellation of elective admissions and staff redeployment in March 2020 to adapt hospital capacity to COVID-19 treatment demands [36] . Hence, although hospital activity was greatly diminished during the first wave of the pandemic, patients who were admitted to hospital were likely to be more acutely and seriously ill and their clinical treatment potentially more driven by \\'therapeutic aggressiveness\\' in situations with sometimes scarce evidence [37] .\\nA more granular measure of hospital activity during the pandemic is required to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on antibacterial prescribing in secondary care.\\nOur data show that antibacterials classified to the \\'Watch\\' (mainly broad-spectrum antibacterials) or \\'Reserve\\' (\\'last-resort\\' or new antibacterials) categories using the WHO\\'s AWaRe index observed increases during the pandemic. Another study has also shown that broad-spectrum antibiotic use in hospitals was common [38] , despite insufficient evidence of a high percentage of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [10, 11] . Third-generation cephalosporins, part of the \\'Watch\\' category, doubled in use in April 2020 compared to April 2019; with specific increases seen in ceftriaxone. This is thought to be due to Trusts selecting the once daily ceftriaxone to save nursing time. However, the percentage of \\'Watch\\' use we present is lower than shown in other studies [11] . Conversely, despite the \\'Access\\' category containing antibacterials that are recommended as first-line treatments for CAP and HAP, the percentage of their use was lower during the first wave of the pandemic. This may be due to approximately 40% of hospitals in the UK reporting that they were already aligned with the published national guidelines, while 12% stated they did not plan to update their local guidelines [20] .\\nDoxycycline and azithromycin were hypothesised as treatments for COVID-19 due to their anti-inflammatory properties and are being investigated in clinical trials in primary and secondary care, respectively. Preliminary results show no benefit of azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and no benefit of either antibiotic for early stages COVID-19 patients over the age of 50 in the community [39] [40] [41] . WHO does not recommend use of azithromycin as treatment of COVID-19 outside of clinical trials due to cardiotoxicity concerns [18] . Our data showed that azithromycin usage in hospital in April 2020 has increased but only slightly, despite considerable media attention given to the potential therapeutic role of azithromycin. This is encouraging and suggests it was not widely used outside trial settings. Although increases in oral doxycycline use occurred prior to the publication of the COVID-19 rapid guidelines, this antibacterial was included in all the national pneumonia guidelines before and during the pandemic.\\nContinued enhanced surveillance is required, as inappropriate antibacterial use could lead to long-term unintended consequences on antimicrobial resistance, and potentially adverse outcomes for patients. In future waves of COVID-19, effective antimicrobial stewardship is required, especially given reported reductions in routine antimicrobial stewardship activities across hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the pandemic [20] . This is to prevent the hard-won gains from previous NHS stewardship schemes, such as the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation scheme [6, 26] , from being jeopardised. As the pandemic reached different areas of England at different times from September 2020 [42] , more work is required to understand the impact of COVID-19 on antimicrobial prescribing during subsequent waves, bearing in mind antibacterial use in winter is generally high for respiratory infections. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on antimicrobial prescribing at a regional level as waves were felt differentially across the country.\\nTo fully understand the impact of COVID-19 on antimicrobial use, patient-level prescribing data, including indications, is required, especially as no demographic data were available for secondary care nationally. This would allow the impact of antimicrobial treatment, including antifungals, on serious respiratory tract infections to be studied by linking to patient outcomes and laboratory records for antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Moreover, since healthcare provision and healthcare-seeking behaviour changed significantly during the first months of the pandemic, additional information on primary care consultations are needed to interpret and adjust for changes in prescribing rates. The role of inflammatory markers needs to be investigated in research such as the National Institute for Health Research funded PEACH trial for procalcitonin [43] , as there is currently limited evidence for their routine use but they have been indicated by hospitals to guide decisions for antibacterial treatments [7] . In addition, further work is needed to monitor antimicrobial use for long-term sequelae of COVID-19, alongside potential unintended consequences of changes in antibiotic use on increasing antimicrobial resistance.\\nClinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are groups of general practices (GP) commissioned for primary care services in their local areas in England. Primary care prescribing included all antibacterial drugs (within British National Formulary chapter 5.1) for all CCGs from dispensed NHS prescriptions in the community, including general practice, out-of-hours, and urgent care. Monthly data were extracted from January 2015 to October 2020 (via ePACT2 from the NHS Business Services Authority) [44] . Data were also extracted by five-year age groups from April 2015. Mid-year CCG population data were obtained from the Office for National Statistics, with the population for 2019 used as a proxy for 2020.\\nNHS acute Trusts are organisations comprising groups of NHS hospitals under the same management that are commissioned to provide secondary healthcare. For secondary care, monthly antibacterial data in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) for all NHS acute Trusts in England were sourced from Rx-info (Define). Data were extracted from January 2015 to October 2020 using the WHO 2019 DDD index [45] . Hospital admissions data for Trusts were obtained from Hospital Episode Statistics sourced from NHS Digital, with 2020/21 admissions data being provisional.\\nAntibacterial consumption was measured in antibacterial items/1000 population in primary care and in DDDs/1000 hospital admissions for secondary care. The trends and changes in consumption from 2015 to October 2020 were described for antibacterials listed in Section 4.3.\\nInterrupted time-series analyses were conducted to evaluate changes in antibacterial consumption in England from the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a quasi-experimental design that can be used to assess whether changes from the population-level interventions are greater than the underlying trend before the intervention [46] . The \\'first-wave\\' of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England was defined for the purpose of this study as January 2020 to October 2020 (the \\'intervention\\'). The pre-pandemic period was defined from January 2015 (April 2015 for primary care age group analysis) to December 2019. The dummy intervention variable was set to 0 pre-COVID and 1 post-COVID.\\nMonthly time-series were constructed using antibacterial consumption as the outcome variable for the pre-and post-COVID periods. Negative binominal regression models (maximum likelihood time-series analysis) were fitted for the event count data according to the distribution of the outcome [47, 48] . Seasonality was adjusted for (in calendar months) as an independent variable in the model, resulting in incidence-rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals [48] . The percentages of specific antibacterials to total prescriptions before and after COVID-19 were compared using linear regression. The regression models were used to predict antibacterial consumption during COVID-19 that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic using the underlying trend (the counterfactual scenario). For the equations and results of the regression models, see Tables S4 and S5. Stata 15 was used in all data analyses [49] .\\nSelection of antibacterials was based on routinely monitored groups under surveillance by Public Health England and published on the Fingertips portal [50] , the annual English surveillance programme for antimicrobial utilisation and resistance (ESPAUR) Report [3] , NHS improvement and assurance schemes [5, 6] , and treatment guidelines published by NICE, including:\\n• Total antibacterial use in both primary and secondary care settings; • \\'Broad-spectrum antibacterials\\', which included amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav), cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones for primary care; • AWaRe categories from the WHO Essential Medicine List adopted in England for hospital settings: antibacterials to improve access to (Access, predominantly narrow-spectrum), to monitor (Watch, predominantly broad-spectrum), and for \\'last resort\\' or new antibacterials (Reserve) [51] ; • Antibacterials for treatment of pneumonia; community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) now for children and young people only [31, 52] , and secondary pneumonia with COVID-19 infection for adults [7, 19] , were defined using the NICE guidelines and the UK Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Prescribing and Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection survey (personal communication); • Antibacterials for treatment of respiratory tract infections (besides tuberculosis) including treatments for ventilator-associated Gram-negative infections; • Specific groups of antibacterials were also investigated; second-and third-generation cephalosporins for treatment of secondary bacterial infections and macrolide antibacterials undergoing clinical trials in hospitals; azithromycin for hospital inpatients in RECOVERY [53] , and macrolides for ICU patients in REMAP-CAP [54] .\\nA full list of antibacterials including their Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes is available in Table S6 for CAP and HAP, and Table S7 for all other selected antibacterials.\\nIn conclusion, overall volumes of antibacterials prescribed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 decreased in both primary and secondary care in England. However, antibacterial usage per hospital admission increased steeply in April 2020 due to changes in the hospital population. Use of antibacterials prescribed for respiratory infections and broad-spectrum antibacterials increased in both settings. This highlights the urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship to ensure appropriate prescribing and avoid negative consequences on patient outcomes and antimicrobial resistance.\\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/antibiotics10070841/s1, Table S1 : Broad-spectrum items prescribed per 1000 population in primary care, December 2019-October 2020.

Figure ', 'Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis and is the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). Since 1974, BCG vaccination has been included in the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization. It is estimated that more than 3 billion individuals have been immunized with BCG and over 100 million doses of BCG are administered annually. Multiple studies have confirmed that BCG is generally safe and can protect children against disseminated disease, including tuberculosis meningitis [1, 2] . BCG also provides cross-protection against leprosy [3] . However, the success of BCG against pulmonary TB in adults is still debated, since randomized clini-cal trials have reported protection efficacy ranging from 0-80% [4, 5] . Several hypotheses for the variation in observed efficacy have been proposed [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\nOne explanation concerns the heterogeneity of the BCG strains [6] . The original BCG was derived from a virulent strain of M. bovis isolated from a cow. From 1908 through 1921, this isolate was subjected to 230 passages on glycerinated potato bile medium, which generated an attenuated strain termed BCG [10] . Distribution and widespread use of BCG started around 1924 and was accompanied by changes in the manufacturing process in production facilities. For instance, while BCG in Sweden was transferred without interruption from bile potato to bile potato medium in accordance with Calmette\\'s original practice [11] , BCG production in Denmark involved alternating rounds of growth on potato bile medium and Sauton broth until 1949 when it was grown exclusively in Sauton medium [12] . Prior to the establishment of seed stocks in the 1960s, BCG was passaged continuously, and the changes in media and transfer schedules contributed to the \"in vitro evolution\" of BCG [6] . It is estimated that as many as 49 production substrains have been used at one time or another in various parts of the world [13] , including the four major BCG vaccines in current use (BCG-Pasteur, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Japan) [14] . The relative protective efficacy of BCG substrains is currently unknown [6, 15] .\\nAnecdotal reports have long indicated that BCG substrains exhibit phenotypic differences in growth characteristics, biochemical activities, ability to protect against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and residual virulence [16] . Over the past decade, numerous groups have sought to identify the genomic changes responsible for these phenotypes. The earliest whole genome comparisons confirmed that BCG was indeed related to, but distinct from M. tb and M. bovis [17] [18] [19] . Subsequent analyses of multiple vaccine strains have uncovered extensive genome diversity including both deletions and duplications in BCG substrains [18, [20] [21] [22] . The phylogeny established by these molecular methods is consistent with the historical records of BCG dissemination [20, 23, 24] . For example, BCG strains acquired after 1927 exhibit the RD2 deletion, while nRD18 is only deleted in strains obtained after 1933. Other genomic changes are exclusive to individual daughter strains, and are associated with vaccine production at specific locations [22, 24] .\\nA number of molecular techniques have been used to investigate genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Early efforts using subtractive hybridization [18] and spotted oligonucleotide arrays [20, 22, 25] effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. More recently, complete genome sequencing has enabled high-resolution analysis of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 [24] , but sequences for other BCG lineages have yet to be determined. To identify potential genomic polymorphisms in other BCG substrains, we have employed a tiling array platform developed by Nim-bleGen Systems. This DNA microarray-based comparative genome sequencing technique allows high resolution detections of sequence polymorphisms [26] [27] [28] . Using this technique, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified a number of novel genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes that are known virulence factors and are expected to have a major impact on the immunogenicity and efficacy of individual vaccine strains.\\nWe have used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of 13 BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau, -Sweden, -Birkhaug, -China, -Prague, -Glaxo, -Danish, -Tice, -Phipps, -Frappier and -Pasteur. All of these strains, except BCG-China, have previously been subjected to genomic analysis by other methods [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . The complete genome sequence of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 is available [24] . The same BCG-Pasteur strain was included in the analysis to serve as an internal control for our experiments in addition to validating the NimbleGen technique. In each experiment, genomic DNA from M. tb H37Rv [29] acted as the common referent.\\nA total of 42 deletions were identified. Twenty-five of these have been described previously [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . Thirteen more represent transposons (e.g., IS6110) present in the referent strain (M. tb H37Rv), but absent from the M. bovis and BCG lineages [24, 29, 30] . Six duplications were identified, four (DU1, DU2-I, -II, -III) of which have been described previously [21, 24] . These results confirm the validity of our approach, and the utility of tiling arrays for comparative genomics. A total of 4 novel deletions and 2 duplications were identified in our analysis. These novel deletions and duplications are described below.\\nTwo deletions specific to BCG-Moreau were identified. The first is a 975 bp deletion ( Table 1 ) that eliminates the distal end of fadD26 (Rv2930/BCG2952) and the start of ppsA (Rv2931/BCG2953). These genes are part of the genetic locus required for the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) [31] , two cell wall lipids known to be important for the virulence of M. tb and M. bovis [32] [33] [34] . In previous work, we demonstrated that BCG-Moreau does not pro-duce PDIMs or PGLs [35] , which is now explained by the fadD26-ppsA deletion identified in the current study.\\nThe second novel polymorphism in BCG-Moreau is an 1128 bp deletion within Rv3887c/BCG3942c (Table 1) . Although intact in other BCG substrains, this region overlaps with a 2.4-kb deletion (termed RDpan) found in some M. bovis strains [36] , including the sequenced strain, AF2122/97 [30] . The Rv3887c/BCG3942c gene encodes a membrane transport protein and is part of the ESX-2 type VII secretion system [37] . The role of the ESX-2 system in virulence is unknown considering its variable presence among clinical M. bovis isolates from both France and England [36] . However, loss of the Rv3887c membrane transporter likely eliminates the secretion of ESAT-6-and CFP-10-like antigens [37] and influences the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain.\\nTwo novel deletions were identified in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug. These polymorphisms are identical between the two BCG strains, which is consistent with their genealogy [24] . The first deletion comprises 110 bp and disrupts the promoter and translational start site of whiB3 (Rv3416/BCG3486) [see Additional file 1]. The other is a 245 bp deletion within trcR (Rv1033c/ BCG1091c) ( Table 1 ). Both genes encode transcriptional regulators known to impact virulence.\\nWhiB3 belongs to a family of seven M. tb transcriptional regulatory proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters and are predicted to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli [38] . WhiB3 responds to oxygen and nitric oxide, and is important for regulation of carbon metabolism [39] . The deletion of whiB3 in M. bovis attenuates in vivo growth in guinea pigs [40] . TrcR is the response regulator of the TrcR-TrcS two-component system. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype such that the strain exhibits increased lethality in SCID mice [41] .\\nAlthough the genomic profiles of BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Sweden are similar, we have also found that BCG-Birkhaug is distinguished by a strain-specific duplication, named DU-Birkhaug. This spans the origin of replication and is analogous to the DU1 duplication in BCG-Pasteur [21, 24] (Fig. 1A) . However, the borders of the DU-Birkhaug are different. Whereas DU1 encompasses 29.6 kb from Rv3910 to pknB/Rv0014, DU-Birkhaug spans a slightly different region, from trxB/Rv3913 to rodA/ Rv0017c. Most of the genes in these regions are involved with DNA replication and cell division. Unlike DU1, DU-Birkhaug also appears to be in a genomic location distant to its original copy. Initial PCR-based attempts to characterize the boundaries of this duplication assumed that the second copy was nearby failed to detect a product (data not shown). As such, the genome location of DU-Birkhaug remains unknown.\\nOur analysis also revealed a novel duplication in the genome of BCG-Tice termed DU-Tice. It comprises a 22kb duplication that encompasses Rv1782-Rv1800 (Fig.  1B ). The precise boundaries and location of this duplication were determined using primers at the junction (Fig.  1C) . Interestingly, DU-Tice encodes the ESX-5 secretion system [37, 42] . This includes several conserved membrane transporters (Rv1782, Rv1783, Rv1795, and Rv1797), a membrane associated ATPase (Rv1784), a set of PE/PPE genes (Rv1787-Rv1792) and the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 family proteins (esxM and esxN) [37] . ESX-5 is absent from the genome of the fast-growing, non-pathogenic M. smegmatis, but present in both the M. avium complex and M. marinum. The role of ESX-5 in virulence has been demonstrated in M. marinum [37, 42] . It has been suggested that the ESX clusters evolved via gene duplication [43] and DU-Tice offers the first snapshot of such an event.\\nTo our knowledge, we have conducted the first genomic analysis of BCG-China, which is a descendant of BCG-Danish obtained from the Statens Serum Institut around 1947. Consistently, BCG-China exhibits the DU2-III duplication and deletion of RD2 (data not shown), which is similar to other BCG-Danish derivatives, including BCG-Prague (obtained in 1946 from passage 725) [44] , \\nThe coordinates correspond to the genome of M. tb H37Rv. The two deletions and DU-Tice were confirmed by PCR application and DNA sequencing.\\nNovel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array Figure 1 Novel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array. Sections of the ratio plot are shown. The ratio of the reference (M. tb H37Rv) probe intensity (Cy5) was divided by the test (BCG strain) probe intensity (Cy3). Reference probes and test probes that do not span a mutation should represent full-length perfect match hybridization, and thus should have similar intensities, with a reference/test ratio near 1. If the test genome contains an amplification event (increased copy number when compared to the reference), then the reference/test ratio will shift below 1. (A) Novel duplication (DU-Birkhaug) identified in BCG-Birkhaug, which is analogous to the DU-Pasteur (DU1) but has different borders. The same genomic region of BCG-Sweden, which is closely related to BCG-Birkhaug, is shown for comparison. (B) Novel duplication (DU-Tice) identified in BCG-Tice. Three other BCG strains belonging to the same group (DU2-IV) are shown for comparison. (C) The precise border of DU-Tice is mapped by PCR amplification using primers specific to the junction. The two copies are immediately adjacent to each other and overlap by 1 bp.\\nBCG-Glaxo (obtained in 1954, from passage 1077) and BCG-Danish (lyophilized in 1961, from passage 1331) [45] . However, BCG-China and -Prague do not contain the previously described deletion of Rv1810, which is characteristic of BCG-Glaxo and -Danish. As such, the Rv1810 deletion must have occurred between 1947 and 1954. Coincidentally, this period corresponds to the replacement of potato bile medium by Sauton medium for BCG production in Denmark [12] .\\nThe PhoP-PhoR system is one of the 11 two-component systems found in the M. tb genome [29] . The PhoR protein is a transmembrane histidine kinase that transmits signals from the environment by autophosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to PhoP, a response regulator that regulates the expression of multiple genes [46] . Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the PhoP-PhoR system, particularly PhoP, plays an essential role in M. tb virulence [26, [46] [47] [48] . A single point mutation (S219L) in the DNA binding region of PhoP partially accounts for the attenuation of the H37Ra strain of M. tb [26] . Furthermore, a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice infections [47] . Our NimbleGen analysis revealed some weak signals in the phoP-phoR region (not shown), which prompted us to resequence these genes. The DNA fragment containing the promoter region of phoP, the ORFs of phoP and phoR, and the intergenic region was PCR amplified from each BCG strain and determined by DNA sequencing.\\nOur sequence analysis revealed a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains compared to the genome sequence of M. bovis. The three early BCG substrains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, contain an identical IS6110 (1,356 bp) insertion at nucleotide 851593 of the M. tb genome, which is 18 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP (Fig. 2) . This IS6110 element is identical to many other copies of IS6110 found in various locations in the M. tb genome. It is flanked by a 3-bp direct repeat (GAA) on both sides and is in an inverse orientation of phoP-phoR (Fig. 2) . The presence of an IS6110 element in the promoter region of phoP in BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau has been described previously, but its insertion site and orientation were not determined until now [49] . Although not present in M. tb H37Rv or M. bovis AF2122/97, an IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter was found in a clinical strain of M. bovis termed B strain, which was responsible for a severe nosocomial outbreak of multidrug resistant TB in humans in Spain [50, 51] . However, unlike the three BCG strains, the IS6110 insertion in the M. bovis B strain is located at 75 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP and is in the same orientation as phoP-phoR [50] . The potential effect of IS6110\\nIS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter in BCG-Russia, -Moreau, and -Japan on phoP expression is described in the \\'Discussion\\' section.\\nThree other novel phoP-phoR polymorphisms that likely impact their functions were also uncovered by our sequencing analysis. An identical, 11-bp deletion within the ORF of phoR was uncovered in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (ACCGGACTGGG, nucleotides from 853689 to 853699, M. tb genome coordinates). This deletion changes the amino acid sequence of 54 residues (residues 432 to 485) in the C-terminal of PhoR. This polymorphism is different than the previously described 10 bp deletion within phoR present in BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, which affects residues 91-485 [24] . BCG-Frappier also contains a single nucleotide deletion (A at 852701, M. tb genome coordinates), causing a frame-shift mutation that affect residues 103-485 of PhoR. Together, these results indicate that besides BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, BCG-Sweden, -Birkhaug, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene.\\nA single nucleotide insertion within the ORF of phoP was uncovered in BCG-Prague (G, between nucleotides 852067 and 852068, M. tb genome coordinates) [see Additional file 2]. This frame shift mutation changes the C-terminal sequence (residues 154-247) of PhoP, which is the DNA binding domain (residues 144-247) [52] [53] [54] .\\nAs such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant.\\nSingle point mutations in PhoP or PhoR are also found in various BCG strains and are summarized in Table 2 . In contrast, sequences of the phoP-phoR locus of BCG-Phipps, -Tice, and -Pasteur are identical to the published sequence of BCG-Pasteur and M. bovis [24, 30] .\\nThe loss of the RD1-encoded ESX-1 protein secretion system during 1908-1921 contributes to the attenuation of BCG ( [55] , see also Fig. 3) . However, because reintroduction of ESX-1 into BCG does not restore full virulence, other genetic lesions are also involved [56] . As such, some strains are more virulent than others in animal models of infection [57] and also exhibit differential ability to induce adverse reactions (reactogenicity) following vaccination in neonates [58] . Our current work begins to provide some explanation for these observed differences (Fig. 3) .\\nConsistent with a previous study [58] , we find that the earliest distributed BCG strains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, all contain a second copy of IS6110 that is inserted in the promoter region of phoP. A similar, albeit distinct, insertion of IS6110 in the phoP promoter was also found in a virulent strain called M. bovis B strain [50] . The presence of IS6110, which is in the same orientation as phoP, increases the expression of phoP and (the resulting [30] . BCG-Danish and -Glaxo contains a 10 bp deletion within phoR, which was described previously [24] . ND: polymorphisms not detected. NA: no affect.\\nincrease in virulence) was thought to be responsible for the outbreak of M. bovis B strain in humans [50] . Similarly, the expression level of phoP was found to be higher in BCG-Japan than in BCG-Pasteur [24] . However, in BCG-Japan, -Russia, and -Moreau, the IS6110 is in the inverse orientation of phoP (Fig. 2 ). As such, how IS6110 upregulates phoP expression in BCG is not immediately apparent and likely involves a different mechanism. One possibility is the elimination of phoP autoregulation. It was shown that PhoP protein, albeit from H37Ra, binds to three 9-bp direct repeats within the phoP promoter sequence and represses its own expression [52] . In BCG, IS6110 is inserted between the PhoP binding sites and the start codon of phoP, which could impair the repression by PhoP and subsequently increase phoP expression. Alternatively, an unidentified promoter sequence within IS6110 in the same orientation of phoP could drive the expression of phoP. The presence of the second copy of IS6110 in these early BCG strains also suggests that the original BCG isolated in 1921 might have been derived from a highly virulent M. bovis strain containing the same IS6110 element. This IS6110 was subsequently lost in other BCG strains (Fig. 3) and is not present in most clinical strains of M. bovis and M. tb isolated in modern times [50, 59] .\\nGiven the important role of PhoP in M. tb virulence, higher expression of phoP could explain why BCG-Russia is generally considered more virulent than other BCG strains [6] . However, in the other early strains, BCG-Moreau and BCG-Japan, the loss of lipid virulence factors PDIMs and PGLs appears to have a more pronounced effect on virulence. Consequently, these two strains, together with BCG-Glaxo, which also lacks PDIMs and PGLs, and as we have described previously, are more attenuated and less reactogenic than other BCG strains [35] . The deletion of fadD26-ppsA described here provides a genetic mechanism for the defective PDIM/PGL biosynthesis in BCG-Moreau. However, this region is intact in BCG-Japan and BCG-Glaxo, indicating that other mechanisms may also lead to the PDIM/PGL defect.\\nBCG-Sweden was obtained from the Institut Pasteur in 1926 while Konrad Birkhaug acquired the strain that bears his name around 1927 [6] . Previous studies indicated that these strains differ from other early BCG strains (i.e., BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau) only by the loss of the IS6110 element described above. Our current work reveals three novel deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (Fig. 3) , which distinguish them from other early strains. Two deletions affect the regulatory proteins WhiB3 and TrcR, and have different impacts on virulence.\\nThe whiB3 gene appears to be important for virulence. The M. bovis whiB3 mutant is attenuated for growth in guinea pigs but not in mice [40] . Conversely, the trcRS two-component system has a negative impact on virulence. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype in SCID mice [41] . BCG-Sweden was used in Sweden from 1926 until 1978 and was then replaced by BCG-Danish because of the high frequency of osteitis associated with the former strain [60] . The deletion of trcR may contribute to the reactogenicity of BCG-Sweden. Figure 3 Refined genealogy of BCG vaccines. The genealogy is modified from a previous model [24] . Genetic markers identified in this work are highlighted.\\nThe other deletion found in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug affects the phoR gene of the phoP-phoR two-component system. Remarkably, three other late BCG strains, BCG-Danish, -Glaxo, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene. Together a total of five BCG strains are natural phoR mutants. However, three distinct mutations are found among these five strains, which correspond to their genealogy (Fig. 3) . The role of phoR in virulence is less understood than for phoP. Among its many functions, phoP is required for the biosynthesis of trehalose-containing cell wall lipids [48, 61, 62] . Contrastingly, phoR does not seem to be required for this function [62] . Nevertheless, the fact that the phoR mutation has been acquired by different groups of BCG strains by three independent events and genetic mechanisms suggests that there was a common selective pressure and an important role for this gene during the in vitro evolution of BCG.\\nAnother BCG strain that contains a major mutation in the phoP-phoR system is BCG-Prague. A single nucleotide insertion in the ORF of phoP changes the C-terminal sequence, which contains the DNA binding domain of PhoP [52] [53] [54] . As such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant and likely to be more attenuated than other BCG strains. This is consistent with the study by Lagranderie et al., which showed in mice models of infection that BCG-Prague exhibited more attenuated phenotypes compared to three other BCG strains (BCG-Russia, -Pasteur, and -Glaxo) [57] . Compared to 11 other BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Moreau, -Japan, -Sweden, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Pasteur that have been analyzed in the current study, BCG-Prague consistently exhibited the weakest ability to induce delayed type hypersensitivity to tuberculin in children [63] or in guinea pig models [64] . Because of the traditional presumption that tuberculin reactivity is associated with vaccine potency, BCG-Prague, which was used in Czechoslovakia between 1951-1980 and appeared to be effective, was replaced by BCG-Russia in 1981 [58] . An immediate increase of BCG-induced osteitis cases was observed in Czechoslovakia following the switch of BCG-Prague to BCG-Russia [65] . The phoP mutation detected in the current study may explain the weak tuberculin sensitivity induced by BCG-Prague. It was recently shown that a phoP mutant of M. tb was more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur and confers an equivalent protection in mice against M. tb challenge. In the guinea pig model, the M. tb phoP mutant showed superior protection to BCG-Pasteur against a high dose challenge with M. tb [47] . Consequently, the M. tb phoP mutant is now being evaluated as a vaccine candidate to replace BCG [66] . Since BCG-Pasteur contains an intact phoP gene, and in light of our finding, it would be worthy to compare the M. tb phoP mutant with BCG-Prague in terms of safety and protective efficacy.\\nThe novel duplication uncovered in BCG-Tice (DU-Tice) may have an impact on its residual virulence and immunogenicity. DU-Tice contains the entire ESX-5 secretion system, which is one of the five type VII secretion systems found in the M. tb complex [37] . Importantly, besides the RD1-encoded ESX-1, ESX-5 is the only other ESX system that has been shown to be involved in virulence thus far [37] . ESX-5 is conserved in other pathogenic mycobacteria and reported to facilitate the cell-to-cell spread of M. marinum in infected macrophages, a function shared by ESX-1 [42] . However, ESX-5 does not complement the loss of virulence caused by ESX-1 deletion, suggesting that they play distinct roles in virulence [37] . Horwitz and co-workers have used BCG-Tice as the host strain to overexpress antigen 85B. This resulted in a recombinant strain termed rBCG30 that exhibits superior protective efficacy over BCG-Tice and is currently being evaluated as a vaccine candidate in human clinical trials [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . The rBCG30 Tice strain also showed significantly stronger immune response and better protection against M. tb challenge than the rBCG30 strain based on BCG-Connaught [69] .\\nThe duplication of ESX-5 in BCG-Tice, which could increase the residual virulence and immunogenicity, may partially account for the benefit associated with rBCG30 Tice.\\nOur current work has uncovered six large sequence polymorphisms not described previously, including two deletions exclusive to BCG-Moreau, two deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug, as well as the DU-Birkhaug and DU-Tice duplications. Moreover, we have uncovered a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains. Remarkably, these polymorphisms affect genes that are well known to have major impact on the virulence of M. tb or M. bovis. These include genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid virulence factors PDIMs/PGLs, genes that encode the ESX family type VII secretion system, and the phoP-phoR two-component regulatory system. [72] . In addition, a mutant of M. bovis deficient in PDIMs/PGLs is being considered as a vaccine to protect wildlife against bovine tuberculosis [73] . Our previous study [35] and current work provide direct evidence that BCG vaccine strains are different in major virulence factors, and likely have different vaccination properties including safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Since new vaccine candidates are evaluated for their vaccination properties relative to BCG, the appropriate choice of BCG strain for these studies is critical. Furthermore, because it is likely that BCG will continue to play a role in tuberculosis control by being included in forthcoming clinical trials, as either a primer to be boosted by new components (e.g. subunit or DNA vaccine) or as an integral component (e.g. recombinant BCG) of new vaccines, greater attention must be given to the benefits that a particular strain may -or may notoffer.\\nThe mycobacterial strains used in this study were: \\nMutation mapping microarrays were designed with Nim-bleGen algorithms that select a 29-mer oligonucleotide every 7 bases on each strand of the reference genome sequence (Genbank Accession AL123456) [29] . All probes were synthesized in parallel on a four-array set using a Digital Light Processor™ (Texas Instruments, Plano Texas) and photoprotected by phosphoramidite chemis-try (Maskless Array Synthesis) (NimbleGen Systems, Madison WI) in a random probe layout [74, 75] .\\nLabeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer at 42°C for 16 hr using a MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah). Labeled genomic DNA (5 μg) from the reference strain M. tb H37Rv and from each BCG strain were co-hybridized to each array. Arrays were washed with NimbleGen wash buffer, and were then spun dry in a microarray high-speed centrifuge (TeleChem International, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and stored until scanned.\\nMicroarrays were scanned at 5 μm resolution using the Genepix ® 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City CA), and pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleS-can™ v2.4 software (NimbleGen). Probes that spanned potential mutations were identified by NimbleGen software. Probe sequences corresponding to all possible candidate mutation sites were selected for resequencing. The strategy that was used to automatically generate the sequencing array is similar to that described previously [28] . Briefly, 8 probes per base position were analyzed, 4 per genome strand. These probes contain all possible alleles at a centrally located position. The length, melting temperature and mismatch position of each probe were optimized. When target DNA is hybridized to these arrays the perfectly matched probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatched probes for each strand. The differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely. These resequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each BCG strain and scanned as above. Sequence base assignments were made using a machinelearning algorithm [76] . Putative mutation-containing DNA segments were PCR amplified and verified by capillary sequencing [see Additional file 3]. The microarray data has been deposited in the Center for Information Biology Gene Expression Database (CIBEX; http:// cibex.nig.ac.jp), with the accession number of CBX70.\\nASL, VT, ZW, and XY performed the experiments and participated in data analysis.
